Washington&#39;s &#39;crime has exploded&#39; have the Democrats ruined the US capital?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-iZi1JFIRY,655,35535,308,"When thinking of Washington DC, grand monuments and museums might come to mind, however, in recent years, America's capital has become more renowned for its growing homeless population and rising crime.

“Crime here has exploded, people do not feel safe,” Isaac Smith, an Emergency Medical Technician in DC, told The Telegraph for a documentary film about the capital.

“I have a bullet hole through my living room,” Mr Smith continued.

“I hear gunshots frequently and I live right next to an elementary school. There’s a bullet hole in one of the [school’s] windows.”

Violent crime in DC has risen by 10% since 2022, which includes a 15% increase in homicides.

Mr Smith blames the Democrats, who have dominated the city’s local politics for decades, for the rise in violence.

“At the end of the day, they don't believe that people have agency. They don't believe that people have free will. So people do not act, they are acted upon.”

Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of the city, will be hosting a Public Safety Summit on Wednesday to engage with locals on how to tackle the increase in crime.

Police investigating an arson and quadruple homicide in an upscale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. on Thursday have now said they believe the four victims were held captive for a day before their house was burned down with them inside. Evidence also shows that there is more than one suspect in the case.

According to a report by local NBC affiliate WRC-TV, firefighters discovered the victims while putting out the fire. The homeowner, 46-year-old Savvas Savopoulos, his wife, their 10-year-old son, and one of their housekeepers were found tied up inside the burning house.

Another housekeeper told authorities that she received a voicemail from Savopoulos on Wednesday night, followed by a text message on Thursday telling her not to come to the house that day.

The family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911 was reportedly seen being driven away from the house at around 10:30 a.m. on the day of the arson. Police found the car at 5 p.m. after it had been set on fire in the parking lot of St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in Lanham, Maryland.

Footage of one of the suspects was captured by a surveillance camera at the church. Police are asking anyone with more information to contact them.

Police investigating an arson and quadruple homicide in an upscale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. on Thursday have now said they believe the four victims were held captive for a day before their house was burned down with them inside. Evidence also shows that there is more than one suspect in the case.

According to a report by local NBC affiliate WRC-TV, firefighters discovered the victims while putting out the fire. The homeowner, 46-year-old Savvas Savopoulos, his wife, their 10-year-old son, and one of their housekeepers were found tied up inside the burning house.

Another housekeeper told authorities that she received a voicemail from Savopoulos on Wednesday night, followed by a text message on Thursday telling her not to come to the house that day.

The family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911 was reportedly seen being driven away from the house at around 10:30 a.m. on the day of the arson. Police found the car at 5 p.m. after it had been set on fire in the parking lot of St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in Lanham, Maryland.

Footage of one of the suspects was captured by a surveillance camera at the church. Police are asking anyone with more information to contact them.

Will Baby K ever be tried in DC murder case?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0FNatzfLZY,66,6571,16,"There's a possibility Baby K, who is a suspect in a D.C. murder, may never stand trial in the District. 16-year-old Kaeden Holland, also known as Baby K, is in custody in Prince George's County on charges of attempted murder. He's accused of trying to kill a student on board a school bus. Prosecutors say he pointed a gun and pulled the trigger-- but the gun jammed multiple times.  In that case, Baby K is being tried as an adult but in the District, he's wanted on a murder charge as a juvenile. A spokesperson for D.C. courts told FOX 5 there's a good possibility he never faces trial in D.C. court. FOX 5's Shirin Rajaee has the latest details.

DC Snipers&#39; Chevy Caprice - A look inside the sniper murder car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAc4TtWwbw,474,75570,96,"20 years ago, the Beltway/DC Snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the  District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for three weeks in a series of coordinated attacks. Ten people were killed at the hand of the DC snipers and three were critically wounded. The ATF produced this video to demonstrate how detectives believed the sniper suspects used a Chevrolet Caprice as a killing machine.

Malvo was a juvenile when he and Muhammad embarked on the killing spree in the DMV. Others were killed as the pair made their way to the D.C. region from Washington state. Muhammad was executed in 2009.

D.C. hospital homicide: patient killed after struggle with hospital guards - TomoNews,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzjUkQDsQe8,36,3795,8,"WASHINGTON — A patient who was killed after a struggle with security guards at a Washington, D.C. hospital last year has been ruled a homicide.

The incident occurred after 74-year-old James E. McBride left the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Sept. 29 without having been formally discharged, the Washington Post reported.

McBride was spotted by a nurse and a security guard not far from the hospital. They walked him back to the hospital grounds, where he was turned over to two other security guards.

According to a police report cited by the Washington Post, McBride became ""non-compliant,"" and a struggle ensued. Two guards forced McBride to the ground while a third ""utilized hand controls to restrain"" him. He died two days after the incident.

The D.C. medical examiner's office ruled on Monday that McBride's cause of death was ""blunt force injuries"" of the neck with ""cervical spinal cord transection"" and ""vertebral artery compression,"" the Washington Post reported.

The security guards involved in the incident are special police officers licensed through the Washington, D.C. police. Two of the guards had previously been put on administrative leave, the Washington Post reported.

A Cop Killer’s Final Battle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kcvvZjaHkQ,537,46658,18,"In April 1995, in Washington D.C., an individual shot a police officer while he and his colleague were in their car. The police asked the FBI for help. A potential suspect was identified, but no trace could be found. After several months of combing the country, the agents finally get lucky. The suspect is in Baltimore, Maryland. A special squad is set up to arrest him. Unfortunately, the murderer is still at work. He finds an unarmed policeman and shoots him in the head as the latter is about to make an arrest. A violent gun battle ensues. The assassin's reign finally comes to an end when he comes under fire from an FBI agent.

About Mark of a Serial Killer:
Some killers are collectors who obtain perverse gratification by habitually stealing mementos from murder scenes, from jewelry to shoes, keys to even body parts. These clues are left to taunt law enforcement and investigators while simultaneously building up their notoriety. Whether it’s text scrawled onto the victim’s body, a cryptic note or a way of positioning the deceased, what is left behind is a trademark clue that ultimately aids the investigation in stopping these murders and bringing the killer to justice.

"Teen Killed, Officer and 2 Adults Injured in DC Shooting: Police",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iL5BXPYoG4,436,31006,90,"A 15-year-old boy was shot to death and three adults, including a police officer, were wounded after a musical event lacking a permit erupted into chaos in Washington DC on Sunday night, police said.

The wounded police officer and the other adults were recovering at hospitals, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III told reporters at the scene of the shooting.

The incident took place near 14th and U Streets NW, about 2 miles north of the White House in the US capital.

Social media had promoted a free music event known as Moechella and several hundred people were gathering in the area around 6 pm, Contee said.

Police arrived to assist the crowd and people stayed mostly to the sidewalks as music played from a truck, he said.

In the hours that followed a fight broke out, and then an incident of an undetermined nature caused people to scatter, Contee said.

Police shut down the gathering, he said, because the event appeared to have become unsafe.

Several people were hurt in the rush to leave the area and were being assisted by public safety first responders when the shooting occurred, Contee said.

He said the events occurred between 6 and 8:30 pm.

A handgun was recovered from one of the victims but not the firearm believed to have caused the death and injuries, Contee said.

No police fired their weapons and there was no exchange of gunfire, he said.

The police chief said officials would be speaking to event organizers and considering what legal action could be taken because the event lacked a permit.

“We will certainly want to make sure that people are held accountable when they hold unpermitted events in our city,” he said.

Car thief ringleader sentenced to 25 years in prison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huNPBgCKMaU,5118,791264,2986,"Montgomery County Judge Sharon Burrell just sentenced Markus Kemp, 23, of D.C. to 25 years in prison.  

""I don't think we've ever had a case that involved car thefts, only car thefts, where there was not violence, that got this kind of sentence, 25 years. It was richly deserved,"" said Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy.

Kemp pleaded guilty to five counts of auto theft, conspiracy, theft over $25,000, and burglary. Prosecutors said he recruited friends and pilfered high-end cars in the suburbs and then rented them out in D.C. for prices up to $1,000 a day.

Kemp was a particularly bold and brazen thief, recruiting buddies from his D.C. neighborhood to case the wealthy, quiet streets of Chevy Chase and Bethesda in the midst of the pandemic lockdown and often in broad daylight, looking for only the most expensive cars, prosecutors said.

He struck at least 13 times between January and July 2020 and made off with more than $450,000 worth of Audis, Teslas and other vehicles.

At one point, he posted on Instagram with a Model X with a base price of $120,990.

""Until it happens to you, you can't believe it..... You're violated, you're violated. Your sense of peace is gone,"" said Paulo Costa, a neighbor of one of the victims.

""This is not the first time the defendant was involved in orchestrating motor vehicle thefts. In 2019, as an adult, the defendant was charged for four separate incidents involving theft, motor vehicle theft, and rogue and vagabond in Chevy Chase, MD. As a result, the defendant was placed on probation in January 2020 (C.R. #135619C) after being convicted of motor vehicle theft as an adult. Only a few weeks after being placed on probation, the defendant violated his probation by engaging in these additional motor vehicle thefts and burglaries."" according to a sentencing memo from the State's Attorney's Office. 

Prosecutor McCarthy said Kemp was a sort of criminal entrepreneur. 

""He would take these high-end cars, take them into D.C., and then he started his own rental business... Each car, $200 to $500 a day. He bragged about the fact that he got $1,000 one day for a single car rental,"" he said.

McCarthy praised the dedicated Montgomery County Police auto theft squad, which broke the case, but has since been disbanded.

One guy who had his Tesla stolen tracked it into D.C. with his phone. When he got to that location and saw no one around, he jumped in his car, started it with his phone, and drove it home, McCarthy said.

0:00 Introduction
2:25 ALL LAWS PASSED BY THE D.C. LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST UNDERGO A 30-DAY REVIEW PERIOD BY CONGRESS BEFORE THEY CAN TAKE EFFECT. DURING THIS TIME, CONGRESS CAN BLOCK THE LEGISLATION.
3:06 17% OF D.C. RESIDENTS LIVE IN POVERTY (30% BLACK PEOPLE) - ACCORDING TO CENSUS BUREAU DATA
3:13 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN PERPETUATING SEGREGATION IN WASHINGTON D.C.
3:17 FOR EXAMPLE THE HOME OWNERS' LOAN CORPORATION (HOLC) WAS A FEDERAL AGENCY THAT WAS CREATED IN 1933 TO HELP HOMEOWNERS REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
3:45 REDLINING WAS A PRACTICE BY WHICH BANKS AND OTHER LENDING INSTITUTIONS DREW LINES AROUND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE HIGH-RISK FOR LENDING.
4:03 BLOCKBUSTING WAS A PRACTICE BY WHICH REAL ESTATE AGENTS WOULD INTRODUCE A SINGLE AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY INTO A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.
4:10 THE REAL ESTATE AGENTS WOULD THEN USE SCARE TACTICS TO CONVINCE NEIGHBORING WHITE HOMEOWNERS TO SELL THEIR HOMES AT A LOSS.
4:27 THESE PRACTICES WERE EVENTUALLY OUTLAWED, BUT THEY HEAVILY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THEY MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO GET GOOD JOBS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL.
5:28 THE LAW INCREASED THE PENALTIES FOR DRUG OFFENSES, PARTICULARLY FOR CRACK COCAINE OFFENSES, WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUG POSSESSION AND DISTRIBUTION.
6:14 FEDERAL COURTS USE DIFFERENT RULES OF EVIDENCE THAN STATE COURTS. THIS CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DEFENDANTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST FEDERAL JUDGES.
6:22 FEDERAL CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY MORE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING THAN STATE CRIMINAL TRIALS. THIS CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DEFENDANTS TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL PROCESS.
7:37 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR 2. POLICY ANALYST 3. CITY MANAGER 4. BUDGET ANALYST 5. URBAN PLANNER 6. NONPROFIT MANAGER 7. HUMAN RESOURCES SPECIALIST 8. PUBLIC RELATIONS SPECIALIST 9. GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR 10. PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATOR
8:11 THE HIGHEST CRIME IN AMERICA IS IN WASHINGTON D.C.
8:15 THE BOTTOM 5% UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE U.S. IS WASHINGTON D.C.
8:18 THE BOTTOM 5% IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES IS IN WASHINGTON D.C.
8:58 THE GUN CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS THE POSSESSION OF HANDGUNS IN DC, EXCEPT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL PERMITS. (ROBBERIES SPIKES)
9:16 THE SUPREME COURT RULES OVERTURNS THE DISTRICT'S BAN ON HANDGUNS IN THE HOME. (ROBBERIES DECLINE)
10:46 HOUSING, FOOD, AND ENERGY. THOSE ARE THE 3 THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO SURVIVE. IF THOSE 3 THINGS BECAME CHEAP ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TO AFFORD THE VAST MAJORITY OF STREET LEVEL CRIME WOULD BE ERADICATED.",2023-06-26T13:00:41Z,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ,Valuetainment

Former DC drug kingpin now out of prison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV9SrRWajF8,3489,461982,685,"Tony Lewis, Sr. went to jail on drug charges in his late 20s. He was supposed to spend the rest of his life in a jail cell, never getting a taste of freedom again. In March, his life took another dramatic turn.

On April 15, 1989, more than two dozen people  were rounded up in D.C., accused of running a massive crack cocaine operation in the region, including Lewis, Sr. That day in 1989 was his last day as a free man — until now — 34 years later.

Tony and his son, Tony Lewis, Jr., spoke with WUSA9 about regaining his freedom. It's a moment the father and son have been dreaming of for decades, even with the elder Lewis' sentence.

He was sentenced to life without parole. 

""It's a slow death sentence, actually. That's what life without parole in the federal prison system is. They don't want to use those terms, but it's a slow death,"" Leiws, Sr. said. 

Lewis, Sr. was 26 at the time. His son was only 8 years old. 

""My mother sat me down and said, 'You need to write him. He needs you. He needs you now.' The backdrop to that, my father was a very present, doting father,"" Lewis, Jr. said. 

The bond between father and son was unbreakable, despite barriers. Lewis, Sr. was worried about his son's safety — navigating life in D.C. during the seemingly inescapable crack crisis, and poverty, but also because his former partner, drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III became a federal informant.

Lewis, Sr. said he hasn't kept tabs on Edmond.

""We were in touch somewhat, until he became an informant for the government and that was it with that,"" Lewis, Sr. said. ""I was somewhat surprised with that occurring.""

Still, Lewis, Sr. said all he could think about was protecting his son. 

""I think his greatest fear was me joining him. He never wavered from, 'This was essentially hell and I would never want you to come here and these are the steps that you have to take to not come here,'"" Lewis, Jr. said.

Instead, the younger Lewis focused on getting his father back home. He organized multiple rallies and a Free Tony Lewis campaign that went on for years. His argument was his father's sentence was unfair and excessive for a violent offender. 

""I broke the law. I understand that. I should have gone to prison, but not for the rest of my life for a non-violent drug offense,"" Lewis, Sr. said. ""I sincerely apologize to D.C. residents and I thank them for forgiving me.""

He was ultimately freed because of a policy established during the Trump administration focused on fair sentences, rehabilitation and second chances.

Lewis, Jr. delivered the news to his dad, still hoping it wasn't a dream. 

""I send him an email that said, 'Big boy, I'm coming to get you on Monday.' He hit me back like, 'Are you projecting?'""

Since then, it's been more than a week of reuniting with his family, grandkids, friends and his community. 

""We're nine days into this and in the morning, he's going with me to take my kids to school and I'm like, 'Is this dude really in the car with me,"" Lewis, Jr. said. 

""I think the same thing. I look back at the girls and I'm like one of my dreams is coming true,"" Lewis, Sr. said. 

He said he is ready to get to work for his community, he has a job lined up, and he's also hoping to amplify his story to keep others from going down the wrong path. As he put it, his jail cell is empty and he wants to keep it that way.

Reign of Terror | DC Snipers 20 years on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfaS96hGV38,813,21169,65,"Innocent people murdered in broad daylight, picked out at random across Maryland, Washington DC and Virginia in in the notorious and fascinating Washington DC Beltway Sniper case from October 2002. 

No motive. No witnesses. No suspects. 

The snipers were literally getting away with murder. Everyone looked to the police for answers, but how would they even begin to solve a crime like this? We revist the case using 3D crime scene reconstructions and archive footage. 

We look at how serial killers Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammad evaded police so successfully, leaving thousands of people terrified to leave their homes, go to the store, fill up their cars with gas or take their children to school. 

Disclaimer: Locations and events have been reconstructed to the best of our ability. This is ultimately our interpretation and may not be entirely true to life.

"Final testimony: Florida woman zipped boyfriend in suitcase, left for dead",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giKTBXmIXs,12,690,7,"Sarah Boone, a Florida woman, has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, Jr. Torres was found dead inside a suitcase in the couple's Winter Park apartment in February 2020. Boone claimed the two were playing a drunken game of hide-and-seek, but prosecutors argued that the video evidence and her own statements to police contradicted her claim of self-defense. Torres' sister Victoria called for Boone to ""rot in jail"" and expressed the triggering effect of using a suitcase.

Biggest Cases of the 80s | TRIPLE EPISODE | FBI Files,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyMen2PgjRA,435,42664,23,"00:00 - S2E12
In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named “Safebet,” that was designed to expose the Chicago Mafia’s infiltration into the city’s surrounding suburbs. Undercover agents quickly discovered that the mob had its tentacles spread into every facet of the law enforcement community.  Agents refocused and sought to expose the corrupt politicians and police.  They unwittingly uncovered the murder of a wealthy socialite perpetrated by a jealous and greedy mob lawyer and covered up by the local police chief.  The conspiracy gave the FBI the leverage they needed to break up the mob’s stranglehold in the suburbs.  

52:00 - S2E15
On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.  The FBI placed Franklin on their Ten Most Wanted list, and an intense manhunt began.  The white supremacist killer, responsible for as many as 20 murders, was arrested two months later by FBI agents in Tampa, Florida.

01:40:00 - S2E18
Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.  Using the profile, agents determined a seemingly unrelated event in Georgia was also the work of the .22 caliber killer.  The profile matched the suspect on every point.  It was enough to put the killer away for life.

Unravel the mystery alongside the FBI's greatest law enforcers and forensic scientists.
