To the man who helped me on 10/29 at 7:50 am on Huntington train right before the Pentagon Metro station,You helped me at the very moment that I found out my brother took his life. I was in a daze and close to hysterical. I blocked out that entire morning. But I remember your kindness and that you hugged me. And you shared that you lost your sister too. And you walked me through step by step what to do to get through the next few hours. You were there for me at the absolute worst point in my life. I‚Äôm not sure I would have gotten past that moment without your help. I don‚Äôt remember if I thanked you. Thank you. My family also thanks you for helping me take the steps to get home to say good bye. ,1gpyoh9,4698,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1gpyoh9/to_the_man_who_helped_me_on_1029_at_750_am_on/

Trespassing / lewd and indecent behavior with a cucumber in Truxton Circle,"On Friday, September 6 at approximately 5:30pm, a man broke into my garage (three kids crashed a stolen car in my fence last week, creating this hole). He stuck a cucumber into the front grill of my car, lowered his pants, and proceeded to have anal sex with it. When a car passes by, he stops and then moves toward the hole to continue. When done, he places the remaining cucumber (two thirds of it having been left in my grill) back in his lunchbox and leaves. 

The video shows the incident but no nudity is visible. 

A police report has been filed. This was in Truxton Circle NW, across from Dunbar High School. If you have any tips, please contact MPD. Be careful out there - protect your car and your produce‚Äôs virtue. ",1fbyx8w,2613,656,https://v.redd.it/6qx7equ6hlnd1

Trayon White just threatened me in my building gym,"Sorry I need a place to vent. 

Trayon‚Äôs in my building gym today playing ball. I saw him and told him I saw him parking illegally here a few times and not to put yourself above the law. He started talking about how there‚Äôs no parking (take the metro clown). He got defensive so I asked him to tell the Rothschilds to keep the weather nice 

He told me don‚Äôt play with him and that he‚Äôll get back at guys that play with him, then called up his goon who came and stared at me while I was working out. Walked over to the goon and he got mad at me for walking up to him as I was taking headphones out asking if he had something to say. 

Trayons a fucking clown. Ward 8 deserves better

Visiting Washington DC Was The Greatest Experience I've EVER Had!,"Just wanted to say, I spent about 3 days in Washington DC and had the time of my life! These past 5 years I've gone through some horrible medical struggles that have turned my life completely upside down. Had to quit my career (teaching) and go on disability. Then a year and a half ago during all this, my wife cheated and left me. Most days I'm in too much pain to even get out of bed. I'm from Florida and have to find doctors around the country who take on complex cases, so I flew up to Pittsburgh this past week to get some testing. Afterwards, I decided to take the scenic way down route 68 in Maryland to arrive in DC, a place I've wanted to visit for as long as I can remember. It was even more amazing than I expected! I went to the National Mall, Ford's Theatre, Holocaust Museum, Smithsonian History, Natural History and Mount Vernon. It really was the greatest experience of my life and it's such a beautiful place! I'm back in Florida now, but I really, REALLY miss DC. Anyways, here's a picture I took of the Washington Monument on a cloudy night. I can't quite explain how I felt when seeing the monument for the first time and experiencing the mall at night, but it just felt...alive. More importantly, I felt alive! Which is a feeling I haven't felt in a VERY long time!",1gyf9qg,2476,78,https://i.redd.it/0rwmjlzt3r2e1.png

DC FEMALES PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR THIS MAN!!,"Hi! I am a fourteen year old female. Today, I was at McDonald‚Äôs when my friends and I noticed a strange man staring at us. We ignored it and continued to eat our food. He then came and sat at the tables behind us giving me and my friend a direct view of him. After a few minutes, we started to notice suspicious up and down arm movements and identified what he was doing. We moved to the barstool table near the digital ordering stations, but the man kept looking around the wall at us. We had some friends from school at the other end of the McDonald‚Äôs and went to go tell them what was going on. This was when we got a full view of this man staring at us and pleasuring himself. Some women got wind of this and called the cops. After about 15 minutes they still hadn‚Äôt arrived and the man was walking around aimlessly with his hands in his pants. We decided to leave and when we walked by him he sat down and unzipped his pants AGAIN. I‚Äôm not sure what happened after this as we ran out but if you see this man, STAY SAFE. I will attach an image of him below.

To the two guys walking their senior dog in Stanton Park yesterday‚Ä¶,"I saw you slowly strolling along, allowing your dog to set the pace, not rushing his park trip. I saw you carefully helping him along in his sling because his back legs weren‚Äôt as strong as they used to be. I saw you rolling a wagon behind for him so he wouldn‚Äôt have to struggle through a longer walk home. I saw your patience. When he needed to take a break laying down in the grass, I saw you gently kneel down to pet him. And I saw you stay there‚Äîa long time‚Äîuntil he was ready to go. 

I saw a sweet, sweet dog enjoying a day with his humans. I saw his grayed face soaking up the sun. I saw him reveling in the comfort of his two people. 

I saw moments of love and unwavering companionship, however fleeting and insignificant they may have been to the rest of the world. 

I wanted to go up and say something to you. I don‚Äôt quite know what I would have said, though, and it wasn‚Äôt a moment for strangers, anyway. I‚Äôm not sure I quite know what I‚Äôm saying now, other than wanting you to know I saw you and your love for your dog yesterday. Thank you for giving him such a beautiful life in his golden years.  

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and the unexpected awards. It is all so generous and thoughtful. This was such a sweet, unexpected, mundane, and beautiful moment yesterday‚ÄîI‚Äôm genuinely glad others are able to share in it. 

I wasn‚Äôt planning on sharing this (but since others did) I, too, lost my senior dog earlier this year. Coming up to the holidays without him has been‚Ä¶hard. But seeing these two guys yesterday, so caring in all the right ways, it just really warmed my heart‚Äîeven if simultaneously bringing memories of my own buddy flooding back. 

To those grieving a loss, I‚Äôm with you. To those with their furry four-legged friends now, please give them extra love. And to all of us, thanks for sharing in such a small, perfect moment in this city. üôÇ",1h0kp9r,1481,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1h0kp9r/to_the_two_guys_walking_their_senior_dog_in/

PSA: Hide an AirTag in your vehicle and maintain its battery. ,"Consider hiding an AirTag in your vehicle and set a reminder to regularly check its battery.

I had just replaced the battery last month.

Carjackings are increasingly common in the DC metropolitan area. If you don‚Äôt have a locating device hidden in your vehicle, consider it. A $30 investment recovered our only car and saved us an extraordinary amount of headache.

For the woman who was groped on the Petworth metro Sunday night and ran to me and my girlfriend:,"First off, we are hoping you‚Äôre doing alright.

We didn‚Äôt exchange contact information because you were clearly in shock and our priority was just making sure you felt safe. 

We did want to let you know that we walked away and called 911. It was your call if you wanted to call the police and report this man (who I also got a visual of) but we wanted to make sure there was at least record of someone else calling with a description of him. 

It is not too late to make a report. Your report may help pinpoint a suspect if he has ever done this to anyone else or if he does this in the future.

I‚Äôm a Delivery Driver who has encountered the Canna Coffee owner,"I want to start off by saying I am not the Driver who was getting berated in the viral video, nor was my encounter super dramatic. However it was a *weird* enough encounter that I recognized him in the video and just thought I‚Äôd share.

This happened roughly a month ago. I received an order for Canna Coffee and drove there to pick it up. I don‚Äôt remember the exact time, but I dash very late nights, so this was around 2-3am.

I walk into the building. No one is there. I wait for a little while but no one shows up. So I call the business number and a man answers. He apologized and said an employee will be there shortly. About a minute later, a man walks in from the entrance (behind me) and greets me. This is the same man seen in the video.¬†

He then starts making a sandwich (the order I was picking up) and tells me I can have a seat. He was very talkative. However I‚Äôm not very talkative, so the conversation quickly died. As I‚Äôm looking around, I start taking in the scenery. I‚Äôm noticing all the posters, NFT grifts, Mary Jane signs, arcade machines, and artwork. I‚Äôm an artist myself so I ask him who made the art.¬†

He replies, ‚Äúuhh‚Ä¶\*long pause\*‚Ä¶.the owner.‚Äú

(I now understand that *he* is the owner, which makes the pause even weirder. Why didn‚Äôt he just tell me he made it?)

I waited about ten minutes for this order, mainly just fucking around on my phone. When he was done, he packed it up and almost handed it to me. Then he pulled it back last second and asked me to tap ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù in the app. For context, asking us to hit confirm is normal, but the whole fake-out thing he did was just weird and immature.

So I tap confirm and he hands me the order. Then he turns around and gives a *thumbs up* to a camera that‚Äôs up in the corner of the shop.¬†

If he‚Äôs the owner, then who was he giving a thumbs up to? Himself?

Anyway, I delivered the order and have rarely thought about it since. Fast forward to this morning, I see a video him screaming at some guy for not knowing English. Same owner.

I don‚Äôt know which hospital I was born however I do know that I was adopted from the Jewish social services that is located in Bethesda, Maryland and I was award of the District of Columbia.  I know that my birth mother was 24 and had a son 4 1/2 years old at the time she found out she was pregnant with me. My birth father was 29 or 30 married with four children, and both families were living in the District of Columbia as far as I know. A journey that I‚Äôm in now is finding my biological family and getting to know them and for them to get to know my family. My adopted parents are now deceased, and they were exceptional parents. I can‚Äôt say anything bad about them and my upbringing and all the opportunities that I was afforded, this search is for me and for me to have existing family in my life. Since my parents death, I feel like I have no family anymore. Hopefully someone will see my pictures and may know somebody that has somebody in the family that knows this story and can contact me. Thank you in advance Patrice.",1gagp8v,1223,119,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gagp8v
An Ongoing DC Pizza Emergency,"""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference.""

I lack wisdom.

There is an ongoing pizza emergency. The size of the delivery bags on the delivery scooters are too small for large pizzas from our favorite establishments. I'm utilizing this bag as a baseline, because it's the ones I see all over town:

[https://transprous.squarespace.com/products/p/large-delivery-bag](https://transprous.squarespace.com/products/p/large-delivery-bag)

The dimensions are 17LX17W

I cold called the following pizza places as a spot check, or picked up a za:

* Andy's Pizza - The Box is 18X18, doesn't fit.
* Wise Guys Pizza - 18inch pizza, doesn't fit,
* We, the pizza - 3 different size boxes for 3 different pizzas, 14, 16 and 20. 20 definitely won't fit. 16 maybe? 14 yes.
* Pazollis - Same deal. Large won't fit. Medium might fit, small will fit.

I called the Transpro company. I told him his delivery bags are too small and was promptly met with ""Who is this?"" ""I'm just a guy who likes pizza"" ""What?"" ""Man, your bags are too small"" ""He said thanks boss and hung up.

This is how I feel right now: ""https://youtu.be/rYy0o-J0x20?si=eldD9fCL9nbnufB1&t=102""

This delivery bag situation puts pizza makers, delivery drivers and all of us in a nasty situation. Somehow, we got to get these guys wider bags. Until the bags are 4 inches wider, we lack the infrastructure for efficient pizza delivery in the nations capital.

Had someone try to piggyback on my metro swipe a few minutes ago.,"As the title says. It was just bizarre. Felt them bump into the back of me on my right side, where I had just put my phone, and I stopped, wondering what was going on. The person then starts pushing me and I just shove them back going ""what the fuck are you doing?"" They then proceed to run at me (admittedly only a few steps) and try to push past me while shouting ""who are you pushing? why are you touching me?"" After several failed attempts, she starts yelling at me that she has no money on her card and I yelled back saying if that was the case why the fuck didn't you say that right away and to just go to the station master who will let you out and you can come back in? At this point, the gate closed and she yelled at me some more and I realized she had a blue tooth in one ear the whole time and was bitching to the person about me. Whole thing was about maybe 45 seconds. Just weird lol. Stay safe everyone.",1grovft,1199,313,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1grovft/had_someone_try_to_piggyback_on_my_metro_swipe_a/

Thank you to the guy that checked if I was ok,"I don‚Äôt want to reveal too much but this happened last night near the U St area. I got into an obvious argument with the guy I‚Äôm dating while we were outside. You walked by and looked at me with concern so I was embarrassed and tried to stay quiet but the argument ended with some loud words exchanged. You turned around to ask if I‚Äôm ok and I just want to say thank you for that. He wasn‚Äôt being physical in any way and I was fine but it felt reassuring to know that there are people who would stand up for someone who looks like they‚Äôre in trouble.

You might‚Äôve noticed I tried to catch up to you after you walked away but I felt a little ashamed and stopped. I know he was pretty rude to you when you tried to intervene so I just wanted a way to say I‚Äôm so sorry and thank you. I hope this interaction doesn‚Äôt dissuade you from helping people in the future if something feels off.

Walking into DC tomorrow (Walking Across America),"
Howdy y‚Äôall,

I should be getting into Richmond today on 367 of my walk across America. I‚Äôm currently down in Woodbridge and after I cross the Occoquan River I‚Äôll pretty much be taking the Mt Vernon trail all the way up to DC. I will stop in Arlington tonight and stay with my friend and then cross over tomorrow morning around like 10/11ish at the Arlington Memorial bridge and spend sometime at the mall.

After that I‚Äôll be in town for 2 weeks doing some advocacy, meeting with electeds, and just enjoying some time in the capital before I head north to the Atlantic at Rockaway beach in NYC. If you see me around at all, feel free to say hi. 

Even in the rain, it should be an incredible moment to see DC from across the river today. I have been preparing for this walk since the end of 2021, and tomorrow, the initial goal of walking from Washington state to Washington DC will be realized. We will see how we feel tomorrow. 

If anyone is interested in following the journey into Washington and around town, the best place to do it is walk2washington on IG/FB. Or if ya want to check out the website walk2washington.com. I‚Äôll probably need to come up with some new handles after I get to DC lol. 

Thanks and looking forward to finally say that I have walk(ed)2washington,

HMR

What is a DC/DMV stereotype that you feel is actually true?,,18sc1id,1163,461,https://i.redd.it/fci1ywmeqw8c1.jpeg
To the incoming members of the next administration,"As you gleefully look for apartments and homes to rent for your new jobs starting in January, I just want to make a single plea for compassion. Many of you are young and/or grew up in a privileged area, or most of your interactions with liberal people comes from social media. You've been told that we're decadent, hate-filled, completely brainless, communists, etc. This is my sad, desperate attempt to convince even one of you that we are not what you've been told.

Starting on January 20th, you are going to wield enormous power over the lives of Americans, and in particular on us here in DC. I am begging you to please look up from your phones, to please stop reading X or watching Libs of TikTok, and look around this city. We are real people, we love our families, we have the same emotions you do. And right now we are terrified, because the man you support has vowed revenge on us, ""the enemy from within"", and there is nothing we can do to stop it. 

I am begging you to resist the urge to be cruel, or to extract vengeance for whatever wrongs for you feel were inflicted upon you or your leader. I am a real human writing this. So is the guy who will be running the Metro car you take to work. So is the random Fed employee working at NOAA who will lose his job because he studies the climate. None of us have wronged you in any way. We protested and voted against your candidate, but that was our same right as Americans that your side has as well. We lost, which means that you are the ones with the power. You get to choose if you grind our faces into the dirt, and you get to choose to show an ounce of mercy. 

I am 99% certain this will be ignored or mocked, because I fear the cruelty runs too deep. But I have literally nothing else left to do.",1gkz59l,1159,441,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1gkz59l/to_the_incoming_members_of_the_next_administration/

I saw him coming and just about managed to get out of the way with the punch only slightly grazing my cheek. My husband shouted at him and chased him off and we called and gave a statement to the cops but we lost sight of him outside the National Archives Museum.

We're both safe, but wanted to make people aware in case this guy tries to sucker punch anyone else.",18trzle,1068,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/18trzle/psa_assaulted_on_the_mall_just_now/
