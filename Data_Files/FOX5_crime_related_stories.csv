"political patties, dc bar that faced online outrage, shutting down","a bar on u street in washington, d.c. is closing its doors less than three months after opening, and in an exclusive interview with fox 5, the couple behind it blames online outrage as a driving factor.","December 4, 2024 9:03pm EST","fox 5 exclusive-a bar on u street in washington, d.c. is closing its doors less than three months after opening, and in an exclusive interview with fox 5, the couple behind it blames online outrage as a driving factor. political pattie's on 9th and u st. was only open 75 days. on wednesday, they shut down for good. owners sydney bradford and andrew benbow told fox 5 they have no regrets about the whirlwind experience, but say it just wasn't the right time or the right place for the concept and internet hate didn't help. the bar was supposed to be a nonpartisan place for people to share ideas and drinks in the heart of a very political city. but after initial backlash right when they opened, the couple who started it — a democrat and a moderate republican — say the experiment is over. ""we feel really strong and confident in the fact that bipartisanship should exist and there should be thought spaces like political pattie's all over the country but this just isn't the right time or place for that concept,"" bradford said. the couple opened political pattie's on sept. 20, just nine days after receiving the keys. the spot used to be a popular gay bar called the dirty goose. political pattie's tagline said wanted to put the 'lit' back in politics, even likening it to a sports bar for politics. but just days after that opening, the place spurred thousands and thousands of online comments, jokes, and outrage. asfox 5 reported, it was initially because their logo had a gop elephant alongside a democrat donkey. they painted over that and changed things but it never really seemed to recover. ""i think two months was enough time for us to really get a good understanding of what we were up against,"" bradford said. ""it's been a tough go,"" benbow said. ""we realize that the concept — and not just our bar concept but the concept of bipartisanship, the concept of reaching across to someone you may disagree with — we're not quite ready to do it. not here in d.c., not across the country."" still, benbow said he has no regrets. rather, he would have regretted if they hadn't tried it out. ""we were no regular bar, this is no regular bar. there were tens of thousands of comments about political patties' before anyone even knew the name political pattie's. from that first stroke of paint went on the building, there was a flood of comments,"" benbow said. when asked about the possibility of revamping and reopening, benbow said ""we believe in our concept, we love our concept, so of course the bar didn't work out but the concept of political pattie's, the spirit of political pattie's still lives. we are not interested at this point in having a bar under a different concept."" the couple said they are announcing what will happen to that space and the management of it 24 hours from now on theirinstagram page. according to d.c. planning and economic development data, there are currently 183 active businesses along the u street main street corridor with a vacancy rate of 7 percent, translating to roughly 13 available spaces. bradford and benbow also said roofing issues at the bar that forced them to close, along with recent deaths in both their families, played a role in their decision. the pair are attorneys and plan to return to law."

dc central kitchen prepares to deliver thousands of free thanksgiving meals,a d.c. nonprofit has kicked their holiday meal prep into high gear.,"November 28, 2024 11:10am EST","washington-a d.c. nonprofit has kicked their holiday meal prep into high gear. volunteers and organizations are hard at work making sure thanksgiving meals are ready to be handed out to the community. thousands of meals will be distributed across d.c. on thursday thanks to d.c. central kitchen. the nonprofit has been around for more than 30 years and this year’s meal distribution comes at a time when food insecurity is seeing a spike. according to a capitol area food bank report, 37 percent of people who responded to their survey did not know where their next meal was coming from at some point over the past year. they have been preparing for the holidays for weeks now but leaders with the non-profit say their work is really year-round. this year, they’re serving about 69,000 meals for thanksgiving. that includes the nearly 30,000 going out thursday, plus their recent turkey distribution along with meals to schools. the non-profit combats hunger and poverty through job training and job creation. the ceo, mike curtin, jr., says organizations that have supported their efforts know food insecurity is a problem. ""we have been in d.c. now for almost 36 years, we are blessed in an incredible amount of support from individuals, from foundations, from corporations around the d.c. area and they recognize the need that exists and have been very generous,"" curtin said. ""that allows us to support our work specifically to work other smaller grassroots organizations, nonprofits that may not have access to that philanthropy."" on an average day, d.c. central kitchen serves about 16,000 meals, curtin said. leaders say this could not be possible without volunteers. teresa poirier was volunteering wednesday with her company.

""he hit the house with a lot of force, it actually shook the house when he hit it,"" sanders said. the incident happened around 4 p.m. sunday, on xenia st. in southeast d.c. toni had been sitting in her living room when she first heard the noises - metal on metal. turns out, the car had hopped the curb and was driving on the sidewalk - taking down fence after fence before crashing through toni's. she ran outside and saw he had hit her house, so she started recording on her phone and then - ""i'm looking at him, he's looking at me and he gets out the car, never says a word - puts on his sheisty mask and takes off down the street,"" toni said. moments later in the video, you see him come back, get in the car and try to drive away - but it's stuck. so he runs off down the street again, this time for good. the craziest part for toni? ""i don't know why he ran! i know him - he knows that i know him, we have interacted before,"" toni said. plus, she said she came to realize that it was truly an accident. the man is a mechanic in their neighborhood and was apparently working to fix the brakes on the mercury for a customer before he took it on a test drive. needless to say - the brakes didn't work. thankfully, toni's sense of humor still does. ""the moral of the story here is if you're going to hire a mechanic, just make sure he knows how to fix the car,"" she said, laughing. but now, toni has to deal with the hassles of both homeowner's and auto insurance, to fix her vehicle, her fence, and structural damage to the front of the home. still, she said she is grateful this week of thanksgiving that it wasn't any worse. ""i am just thankful that the car did not hit me as i stood in the doorway and i'm thankful that it didn't hit the gas line as the gas line is right next to the porch, and it could have easily gone a completely different way,"" toni said. at least five other neighbors have torn up fences from the damage as well. d.c. police tell fox 5 they have been in contact with everyone involved and the charge in this case is 'leaving after colliding.' fox 5's homa bash spoke with the driver of the vehicle after the report aired - he told her that he ran off because he wanted to secure his tools that were down the road and was then detained by officers on scene. he was told by police that it is up to the district attorney's office whether charges will be filed."

""after more than two years of serving the washington, d.c. community, the safety of our guests and employees remains our top priority. due to increasing security concerns in the area, including the necessity of daily armed guards, we have made the difficult decision to close taffer’s tavern,"" the statement said. fox 5 has followed up with the executive chef for more information and, as of this writing, has not heard back. last spring, taffer spoke with fox 5 and made a reference to hiring armed guards and making sure people felt safe, while reiterating the restaurant’s commitment to chinatown.

""my wife and i have lived here since 2014. we take our dog out four times a day, including after 9 p.m., between 9 p.m., and 11 p.m., we’ve never felt threatened at all by any kind of violence,"" marks said, ""it’s provided a great deal of zest and good feelings here in the neighborhood. we’re going to thrive with the caps being here, the wizards, the mystics."""

maryland governor defends $190k trump-centric consulting contract as president-elect moves in next door,maryland’s democratic governor tapped one of the world’s largest risk-management firms for a short-term contract in preparation for republican president-elect trump moving in next door.,"November 22, 2024 10:50am EST","washington, d.c.-maryland’s democratic governor tapped one of the world’s largest risk-management firms for a short-term contract in preparation for republican president-elect trump moving in next door. gov. wes moorehired accenture plc, an irish it and consulting firm with an estimated $60 billion in revenue, to be its eyes and ears on trump’s return to washington, d.c. two days after trump was projected to win, maryland finalized its $190,000 contract. consultants at accenture have been charged with analyzing how trump and congressional republicans willaffect maryland,including in terms of federal monies sent across the anacostia river as the new administration signals a major belt-tightening. the contract includes a section focused on identifying state ""resources and efforts and consider potential avenues for legal challenges."" it also seeks to track trump’s agenda and his circle’s engagements with third-party groups like the heritage foundation, according to thebaltimore sun. moore appeared to acknowledge there will betimes maryland’sinterests run counter to the white house’s, but suggested his hiring of accenture was not to create such an overtly adversarial relationship as critics have suggested. a spokesman for moore appeared to dismiss claims the governor is trying to set up a showdown, saying there are four tenets guiding him into a new trump era: ""defend our constitutional rights, grow our economy, and restore faith in our public servants [and] our institutions, and our democracy."" ""governor moore is ready to work with the incoming administration to ensure these goals are accomplished, and where there is common ground to be found, he will find it. not only as a matter of principle – but as a responsibility to the people the moore-miller administration represents."" the spokesman said hiring a firm like accenture is standard practice in business, and that with the ""unique role"" the federal government plays in maryland’s economy, it is important to fully understand how best to work with trump. ""with billions of dollars in potential liabilities for the state, it would be reckless of the moore-miller administration to not be prepared for any new policy directions taken by the federal government."" like virginia and the district of columbia itself, maryland is inextricably linked to the federal government, which also comprises just under 10% of the state’s workforce. the old line state houses several federal agency headquarters. nasa’s goddard space center boasts its own private exit off the baltimore-washington parkway, the nih campus sits in bethesda and the fda calls silver spring home. geographically, what remains of the original federal district is also entirely former maryland territory – as arlington and alexandria retroceded to virginia in 1847. fox news digital reached out for comment from state house minority leader jason buckel, r-cumberland. buckel toldmaryland mattersthat the contract is ""not in the best interests of any marylander, particularly under the unified control of our federal government by republicans,"" and suggested the contract is ill-timed given maryland's reported billion-dollar deficit. d.c. and virginia have also keyed into sweeping changes the trump administration could bring to the region. district of columbia mayor muriel bowser has requested a meeting with trump,according to fox5dc, while virginia gov. glenn youngkin was – unlike the other two leaders – a prominent trump backer with few apparent concerns. ""i look forward to having the wind at our backs as opposed to in our faces about everything that we’re doing because we’ve gone from the bottom of job growth to near the top of the country,"" youngkin said. however, in fairfax county, which, like maryland’s prince georges and montgomery counties, is home to a high proportion of federal workers, the top municipal leader warned of repercussions. board of supervisors chairman jeffrey mckay told fox5dc that fairfax must ""prepare to address the potential impacts of the new administration."" he said a second trump term poses a ""risk"" and noted trump has a stated goal of ""dismantling government bureaucracy."" a representative for accenture referred fox news digital back to moore's office."

""we think if you remain bitter, remain upset about what occurred – even though it was an atrocity and it was injustice – that you stay locked up mentally."" this case, explored in the podcast ""the alley: dc’s 8th and h case"", has highlighted claims of suppressed evidence, coerced testimony, and investigative flaws. seventeen individuals were arrested in connection with fuller’s murder, with eight ultimately convicted. of the six still alive, all maintain their innocence after collectively serving more than 200 years behind bars. shannon lynch, head podcast producer and studio manager at new america, emphasized the brothers’ resilience. she has spent more than 3.5 years getting to know each of them individually to tell their story. ""i - of course - will never even come close to understanding to how it feels to have your name dragged through the mud in the way that theirs have been, but what’s more important to look at is what they’ve done since then,"" she said. the turners have immersed themselves in the community and remain optimistic about their future, despite the limitations imposed by their felony records. ""we’ve actually said we might join the police force if we didn’t have this on our record… i used to want to be in the navy. i can’t serve my country because i have a record,"" said charles turner, reflecting on the opportunities he missed. their fight for a pardon, supported by the mid-atlantic innocence project, represents a critical step in restoring their reputation and erasing their record of any wrongdoing.. executive director, shawn armbrust, has personally been dedicated to the case for 20 years. ""we decided that we had to do it because at the end of the day we can’t quit on them,"" armbrust said. charles turner expressed hope that a pardon would not bring validation to himself and the other 5 convicted men, but also his family, friends, as well as others who have supported him along the way. ""it would also validate – help to validate – what they know, not what they believe, but what they know. there’s a big difference there."" historically, most presidential pardons are granted between election day and inauguration day, but no timeline has been given for the applications of the convicted men. for more information about the case and to and how to get involved, clickhere: in addition, you can listen to the ""the alley: dc’s 8th and h case""wherever you get your podcast onspotifyorapple podcasts."

""i’m preaching this very loud. their families need to be held responsible for this, too. it’s their fault they were out there. i was a single mom. i always knew where my kids were. i always knew what they were up to. i gave them love. i gave them what they needed to be decent people."" sandoval, who lives in colorado, said smith was planning on moving closer to her before his death. the family just lost smith’s older brother due to a brain aneurysm three months ago, sandoval said. both brothers died at the same hospital in virginia.

""right now, their [suspects] age means nothing to me. they killed my son. their age means nothing to me. i want them to spend their whole life…not six years, because they’re minors. they destroyed my life completely. i have no children life now, and they have destroyed my whole reason for living."" related:beloved dc dj dead following brutal attack in shaw: police the suspects’ arrests were announced by d.c. police on nov. 15. at the time, police said evidence led them to believe these two robbed smith, but his death was still under investigation.

""the pardon power is unlimited,"" said mark graber, a constitutional law professor at the university of maryland. ""let’s imagine a different president who decides, ‘i’m going to pardon everyone engaged in insider trading who is over six feet tall.’ utterly arbitrary. they can do it."" incoming white house press secretary karoline leavitt provided some clarification, stating, ""president trump will make pardon decisions on a case-by-case basis."" the doj continues to allocate significant resources toward these cases, underscoring the government’s commitment to holding those responsible for the capitol riot accountable. for now, the future of these cases hangs in the balance, as federal judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys navigate a landscape shaped by the possibility of mass pardons in a second trump administration."

""when you call 911 and it’s not an emergency, then our 911 takers who are trained in handling emergency situations and are able to give you directions to get you through the emergency, what they are then doing is sometimes transferring you out or explaining city services and sometimes why it’s not an emergency and transferring you out,"" she said tuesday. ""we’re spending a lot of time not only why we’re not able to process that as a 911 call, but also where the right place to get that processed or get that problem solved is."" over the past two years, mcgaffin said there has been a trend noting an ‘uptick’ in call-takers staying on the phone longer. ""when we do quality assurance on those, what we’re finding is a lot of times it’s about education we’re doing on the 911 line,"" she said. ""what we do know anecdotally is that there have instances where people have been in the queue for emergency while we were handling things that were not necessarily emergencies. what we’re really trying to do is take this education out to the community."" launched tuesday, the ""make the right call campaign"" is aimed at educating residents and visitors about when it is appropriate to dial 911, and when they should instead utilize 311 to access the police non-emergency line and to request city services. mcgaffin said a good rule of thumb is to call 911 when your life or property is in danger. in some cases of crime, 311 is more appropriate to call. ""if you go outside in the morning and you see that somebody has taken your wallet out of your car that was unlocked, we want you to call 311,"" she said. ""we’re still going to call officers to process that, most likely through our telephone reporting unit. you’re still going to get help. it’s just not going to be as quick as somebody who is experiencing an emergency where police need to respond in a faster priority."" in late september, ouc was the focus of an oversight roundtable after multiple high-profile response issues including the death of a five-month-old and delays to advanced medical health when the baby’s parents called for help. the hearing included questions about staffing, which mcgaffin said as of tuesday was improving. there are currently six open positions for 911 call takers. full capacity would be 105 call takers. last june, there were 36 vacancies. tenaj gueory has been with the agency for almost three years. while she’s passionate about the job as a 911 call taker, gueory admits it takes a take emotionally and can be demanding. ""calls come in every few minutes. sometimes they come in every few seconds, i can finish a call and i’ll get a 15 second break. then i have another one coming back.  it can be like that,"" gueory said. mcgaffin said an incentive program launched in august offering employees $800 a month for not calling out for a shift has shown to be effective. it will likely stay in place for the rest of the month and possibly through december, she said."

""their crimes span from attacks on cops, apartment takeovers, hotel takeovers, gun smuggling and atm scams. they run the gambit with their crimes,"" taer said. the gang originated more than a decade ago in an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of aragua, according to the associated press, and has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million desperate venezuelans fled economic turmoil underpresident nicolás maduro’s rule. now, there are concerns about its ruthless tactics reaching u.s. shores as members infiltrate the nearly 1 million venezuelan migrants who have crossed into the u.s. in recent years. in loudoun county, sheriff mike chapman tells fox 5 they have not identified the gang in their jurisdiction but he has a message for them. ""don’t come here because we are going to lock you up and we’re going to get you for whatever you do here, you’re going to do your time and then you’re going to get shipped back to wherever you came from,"" chapman said. d.c. has been labeled a sanctuary city by the incoming trump administration, which is pledging to use the u.s. military to deport illegal migrants who commit crimes. the associated press contributed to this story."

""they use the word change a lot, and we think this is an attempt to change the landscape of who our elected officials are! to go in reverse? when we’ve made great strides in having women, people of color, lgbtq on the council,"" said deidre brown, a leader in the vote no on 83 organization. ranked voting is where voters pick their preference of five candidates, and those candidates square off until one receives a majority. it would mean the candidate who wins would need over 50% of the votes. voters would be able to put their top choice candidate at the top of the ballot, but also rank your second, third, fourth choice, and so on. supporters see it as another way to open things up in d.c. ""not only does it guarantee that the winner of an election would receive a majority of the votes but it is a process that encourages minority candidates and injects civility in elections. when candidates are ranked by voters, the slogan that 'every vote counts' takes on an even deeper concrete mathematical meaning. also, if you are a candidate who wants to be a voter’s second choice, it helps if you not engage in negative campaigning,"" said philip pannell, treasurer of yes on 83. this ballot initiative is going before d.c. voters because backers were able to get enough signatures to get it on the ballot. mayor muriel bowser’s office tells fox 5 that the mayor opposes initiative 83. ward 8councilman trayon white has vowed he will stay on the ballot on election day, amidst bribery charges. in august, white wascharged with one count of bribery. the u.s. department of justice says white is accused of agreeing to accept $156,000 in exchange for working to extend violence interrupter contracts. the transactions and discussions were reportedly captured on video. the federal indictment included pictures showing white accepting envelopes of cash. white pleaded not guiltyin federal court on sept. 12. he wasremoved from his committee leadership rolefor recreation, libraries, and youth affairs on sept. 17. ""the reality is yes, i’m on the ballot,"" said white to constituents in september. white’s arrest cast a shadow over his reelection campaign, and his republican opponent, nate derenge, is making sure voters don’t forget about it. derenge, the only name on the ballot challenging white in november, has used the scandal as a rallying cry for his campaign. his slogan, ""not a bribe-taker,"" has been plastered across his social media profiles, with an image of white wearing a crown and the word ""betrayal"" in bold letters. derenge hasn’t held back — he even released a rap video mocking white’s legal troubles. derenge, who moved to historic anacostia in 2015 and bought a home in fairlawn two years later, works full-time and volunteers at local nonprofits like the house dc and the dc dream center. his roots in the community and focus on ending the cycle of poverty have drawn some attention, but whether his bold, often harsh rhetoric will resonate with ward 8 voters remains to be seen. despite the federal bribery charge, many political analysts believe white remains a favorite to win reelection, citing his deep ties to the community and the support he has built over his years in office. but with derenge’s aggressive campaign centering on the bribery allegations against his opponent, the race has become much more competitive. track and streamlive, updated 2024 election resultson election day for the presidential election, balance of power in the house and senate, and local races across virginia, maryland and d.c. on the free fox local app for smart phones and tvs, orfox5dc.com/election."

""they were just calling us names, questioning why we are gay and f****, bunch of names,"" nieves said. ""they started throwing punches because i said it was none of their business who we are, if i’m gay or not."" despite the harrowing experience, nieves and capell remain optimistic about their new life in d.c. ""we’re still happy to be in d.c. and make our lives here,"" nieves stated. metro officials confirmed that the case is under active investigation, and they are currently searching for the suspects involved in the attack."

""i make mistakes. but here’s what i promise you: i will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me. i will always tell you the truth, even if it’s hard to hear. i will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. and if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way."" harris began her capstone speech by reminding voters of trump’s role inthe chaos of jan. 6, 2021, when he spewed falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election that inspired a crowd to march to the capitol and try unsuccessfully to halt the certification of democrat joe biden’s victory. she brought up his threats to use the military against his political rivals and his labeling of those who disagree with him as ""the enemy from within."" ""look, we know who donald trump is. he is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the united states capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,"" she said. trump, she added, ""has spent a decade trying to keep the american people divided and afraid of each other."" ""this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,"" she said, branding trump a ""petty tyrant"" and ""wannabe dictator."" harris continued: ""but america, i am here tonight to say: that’s not who we are."" she added, ""it doesn’t have to be this way."" harris sought to use her largest remaining stage before polls close to make a broader case for why voters should reject trump and consider what she offers, while still introducing herself to voters clamoring for more information. the white house gleaming behind her, harris encouraged the crowd to visualize their divergent futures depending on who wins on election day. ""in less than 90 days, either donald trump or i will be in the oval office,"" she said. ""on day one, if elected, donald trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. when elected, i will walk in with a to-do list."" harris went on to list key policy goals, including expanding medicare coverage of home health care, boosting the supply of housing in the country and working to restore nationwide access to abortion. her speech drew a massive crowd to washington, with supporters spilling out toward the washington monument on the national mall. more critically, her campaign hopes the setting will help attract the attention of battleground state voters who remain on the fence about whom to vote for — or whether to vote at all. ahead of harris’ remarks, her campaign showcased a line-up of ordinary americans who spoke about their dream and priorities, rather than showcasing the star power that has been featured at some recent harris events. they included amanda zurawski, a woman who nearly died from sepsis after being denied care under texas’ strict abortion ban, craig sicknick, the brother of capitol police officer brian sicknick, who died in the wake of the jan. 6 attack, and a pennsylvania husband and wife who previously voted for trump but now back harris. ruth chiari, 78, of charlottesville, virginia, was attending the rally with her husband to ""support democracy.""

""i like she chose this place for her closing,"" she said. ""having something that is a direct contrast to that day is what we needed."" with time running out and the race tight, harris and trump have both sought big moments to try to shift momentum their way. the address came days after harris traveled to texas, a reliably republican state, toappear with megastar beyoncéand emphasize the consequences for women after the u.s. supreme court overturned roe v. wade. that, too, was a speech meant to register with voters far away in the battleground states. the vice president’s latest address has been in the works for weeks. but aides hoped her message would land with more impact aftertrump’s rally sundayat madison square garden in new york, where speakers hurled cruel and racist insults. harris said the event ""highlighted the point that i’ve been making throughout this campaign."" ""he is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country,"" she said. ""unlike donald trump, i don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,"" harris said. ""he wants to put them in jail. i’ll give them a seat at my table. and i pledge to be a president for all americans. to always put country above party and above self."" also, central to her message: positioning herself as a ""new generation"" of leader after trump and even her current boss, president joe biden. ""it is time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,"" she said. ""it is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division. it is time for a new generation of leadership in america. and i am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the united states."" she acknowledged that ""many of you are still getting to know who i am"" after her surprise elevation to the top of the democratic ticket after biden dropped out of the race in july, and used her remarks to try to answer voters’ curiosity.

""we’re trying to get better,"" saidsix-time all-pro linebacker bobby wagner, who forced the fumble by watson that luvu recovered. ""there’s still stuff that i feel like we can fix. each week we just want to get better, and i feel like we’re doing that."" the signs of improvement are there. the commanders had the worst third-down defense in the nfl through the first four weeks of the season. they held cleveland to 0 for 12 on third down with watson in the game and 1 for 13 overall counting garbage time when the outcome already was decided. they also made watson’s life difficult with the seven sacks, thanks to blanket coverage and more pressure than he expected.

""whenever you get that amount of sacks, the (defensive backs) should get a lot of credit because they played really well. and they made it tough for him."" rookie quarterback jayden danielsflashed more brilliance, made one mistake and acknowledged his play was not the biggest reason for the latest win.

""they gave us opportunities, even when we weren’t clicking at first, to get back on the field and get into a groove, get into a rhythm. without them, we would not have been in this position."" daniels has had some rookie moments, like his interception just before the goal line against cleveland, but many more in which he looks like he has been in the league much longer than five games. washington’s offense surpassed 400 yards for the fourth time in five games, and daniels & co. are clicking on all cylinders running and throwing the ball. ""you can kind of see, the tempo’s been getting to the defenses, for sure,"" right guard sam cosmi said. ""they’ve been tired, which is just allowing us to make explosive plays."" red zone play on offense, which was excellent at arizona, has hit another lull. daniels’ interception and a couple of other drives stalling cost washington some points along the way.

"biden says lead pipes must-go nationwide, sets new 10-year deadline for us cities","president joe biden set a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all americans, a decade after the flint, michigan, water crisis.","October 9, 2024 10:26am EDT","washington-presidentjoe bidenset a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all americans, a decade after theflint, michigan, water crisis. the crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water and the number of americans being impacted by it. biden announced the final environmental protection agency rule during a visit to the swing state of wisconsin in the final month ofa tight presidential campaign. the announcement highlights an issue — safe drinking water — thatkamala harrishas prioritized as vice president and during her presidential campaign. the new rule supplants a looser standard set by former presidentdonald trump’sadministration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes. ""folks, what is a government for if it cannot protect the public health?"" biden asked a crowd of union members at a cavernous department of public works warehouse in milwaukee. the city has the fifth-highest number of lead pipes in the nation, according to the epa. decades after the dangers of lead pipes were clear, more than 9 million lead pipes remain in use, a fact biden called shameful. ""we’re finally addressing an issue that should’ve been addressed a long time ago in this country,’' he said. ""we are showing up as a partner to get it done."" epa administrator michael regan said milwaukee is one of many cities across the country taking steps to remove lead pipes from their drinking water. officials are using money from the federal infrastructure law to accelerate lead-pipe replacement work and meet a goal to remove all lead pipes within 10 years, down from an initial 60-year timeframe. ""everyone wants this lead out,"" regan told reporters. ""the science has been clear for decades — there is no safe level of lead in our drinking water."" the new epa rule is the strongest overhaul of lead-in-water standards in roughly three decades. lead, a heavy metal used in pipes, paints, ammunition and many other products, is a neurotoxin that can cause a range of disorders from behavioral problems to brain damage. lead lowers iq scores in children, stunts their development and increases blood pressure in adults. the epa estimates the stricter standard will prevent up to 900,000 infants from having low birth weight and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths a year from heart disease. the new regulation is stricter than oneproposed last falland requires water systems to ensure that lead concentrations do not exceed an ""action level"" of 10 parts per billion, down from 15 parts per billion under the current standard. if high lead levels are found, water systems must inform the public about ways to protect their health, including the use of water filters, and take action to reduce lead exposure while concurrently working to replace all lead pipes. lead pipes often impact low-income urban areas the most. they are most commonly found in older, industrial parts of the country, includingmajor citiessuch as chicago, cleveland, new york, detroit and milwaukee. the rule also revises the way lead amounts are measured, whichcould significantly expandthe number of cities and water systems that are found to have excessive levels of lead, the epa said. to help communities comply, the agency is making available an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water infrastructure throughthe bipartisan infrastructure law.the agency also is awarding $35 million in competitive grants for programs to reduce lead in drinking water. the 10-year timeframe won’t start for three years, giving water utilities time to prepare. a limited number of cities with large volumes of lead pipes may be given a longer timeframe to meet the new standard. lead pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water; removing them sharply reduces the chance of a crisis. in flint,a changein the source of the city’s drinking water source more than a decade ago made it more corrosive, spiking lead levels in tap water. flint was the highest-profile example among numerous cities that have struggled with stubbornly high levels of lead, includingnewark, new jersey,benton harbor, michigan, and washington, d.c. the original lead and copper rule for drinking water was enacted by the epa more than 30 years ago. the rules havesignificantly reducedlead in tap water but have included loopholes that allowed cities to take little action when lead levels rose too high. ""epa’s action today is a leap forward in protecting the health of tens of millions of americans from this scourge,"" said erik olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit natural resources defense council. actually getting the lead pipes out of the ground will be an enormous challenge, however. the infrastructure law approved in 2021 provided $15 billion to help cities replace their lead pipes, but the total cost will be several times higher. the requirement also comes as the biden administration proposes strict new drinking water standards for harmful ""forever chemicals"" called pfas, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. these standards will cost billions of dollars. the american water works association, which represents water utilities, said it supports epa’s goals but warned that removal of lead pipes ""poses cost challenges.’' ultimately, most of the costs will fall to consumers through higher water bills, said awwa ceo david lafrance. fifteen republican attorneys general, led by kris kobach of kansas, have criticized the epa rule as ""unworkable, underfunded and unnecessary."" the gop officials said they are concerned that homeowners in some places might have to pay to replace pipe sections under their property – a requirement kobach said congress did not authorize. federal grants worth billions of dollars will help communities replace their pipes, the epa said, but cost decisions ultimately are up to local utilities. regan said the benefits of the rule far outweigh the costs. ""we believe we’ve done it in a very strategic way — a legally sound way — supported by the science,’' he said. another hurdle is finding the lead pipes. initial pipe inventories are due this month, and many cities have said they don’t know what substances their pipes are made of. without knowing their location, it is hard to efficiently replace them, according to eric schwartz, co-founder of blueconduit, a company formed in response to the flint crisis that helps cities find their lead pipes. avenel joseph, interim executive vice president of the robert wood johnson foundation, called access to safe, affordable water a basic human right. ""for generations, lead exposure has silently robbed millions of children — especially those living in communities of color — of this right,’' she said. ""with this regulation in place, our country finally says: no more.’' the associated press contributed to this report."

new dc law aims to curb reckless driving by out-of-state drivers,"the steer act, a d.c. law aimed at road safety passed earlier this year, had components go into effect on october 1.","October 1, 2024 6:39pm EDT","washington-the steer act, a d.c. law aimed at road safety passed earlier this year, had components go into effect on october 1. among some of the changes: it’ll create the opportunity to add speed restrictions to vehicles for drivers who violate d.c. traffic laws. it’ll also ensure that if someone has their car stolen and the plate racks up tickets, that victim won’t have to pay the fines. but the biggest change the steer act creates: going after out-of-state drivers who rack up huge fines. if a traffic camera catches a d.c. resident, that person must pay the fine to renew their registration in the district. but out-of-state drivers don’t have to pay their d.c. fine to renew wherever they live. the impact of this: some out-of-state drivers aren’t as cautious driving around d-c. according to data provided by the department of public works, the overwhelming majority of out-of-state plates getting citations in the district are in maryland and virginia. in fiscal year 2022, those plates got 757,268 citations totaling $151,250,000 in unpaid fines. in 2023, 808,933 citations totaling $160,700,000 in unpaid fines. d.c. resident katherine eyster tells fox 5 she thinks this is a fairness and safety issue: it’s unfair that d.c. residents have to pay, and she sees out-of-state drivers who aren’t careful on d.c. streets. ""it’s certainly tough to say, but when you look at the numbers and that some of these drivers, we’re not talking about folks who are distracted here and there, we’re talking about folks who are dangerous and shouldn’t be on the road. and so, hopefully that makes a difference,"" eyster said. this new law now allows the d.c. attorney general’s office to sue these out-of-state plate owners in d.c. court, get a judgment, then try and enforce that judgment in the state where the plate owner is registered. council member charles allen heads the council’s transportation committee. he says this bill adds teeth to d.c.’s traffic enforcement. ""it’s important, i think, to send that strong signal that the attorney general is going to be coming after you, that we are going to make sure we put teeth into that reckless driving and making sure we get those drivers, hold them accountable, and get them off our streets,"" allen said. fox 5 has learned the attorney general’s office will add two attorneys whose full-time jobs will be filing these suits in d.c. to secure these judgments. that sounds like a small number given the number of unpaid citations, but allen thinks this will be a key deterrent and important tool. ""i think we will see a significant impact and i think it will result in safer streets. let’s not kid ourselves that one law is going to magically change it all, you have to have better engineering, you have to build safer streets and intersections, we have to help educate drivers to make sure they’re learning and driving more safely. but we have to have enforcement, and this legislation, this law, is going to help improve enforcement,"" allen said."
district dogs agrees to pay $100k and improve safety after flash flood tragedy,district dogs has reached a settlement with the district of columbia following a tragic flood last year that resulted in the deaths of 10 dogs at its rhode island avenue location.,"October 1, 2024 4:28pm EDT","washington-district dogs has reached a settlement with the district of columbia followinga tragic flood last year that resulted in the deaths of 10 dogsat its rhode island avenue location. as part of the agreement, the facility will remain permanently closed, and the company will pay $100,000 to the city. the settlement also requires district dogs to improve safety protocols across its other locations in d.c. the flash flood occurred on august 14, 2023, in northeast d.c., an area known for flooding. at the time, 10 pets were inside the rhode island avenue district dogs facility, which had floodedmultiple times the previous summer. despite those incidents, the company reassured customers that their pets were safe. ""i feel a lot of anger that this has clearly happened in the past so many times and there was no emergency plan... there was nothing to fix it to make sure that the dogs were ok,"" said jocelyn lobos-segura, whose dog, mona, drowned during the flooding. attorney general brian schwalb announced the settlement tuesday, noting that the company will be required to develop detailed emergency response and evacuation plans for each facility, train staff on those procedures, and obtain risk management certification. ""what happened at district dogs’ rhode island avenue location was a pet owner’s worst nightmare,"" said schwalb. ""our investigation will result in improved safety at all of district dogs’ facilities in d.c. — ensuring that no district resident loses a pet in such a tragic and avoidable way."" district dogs, which operates multiple locations in d.c. and northern virginia, said in a statement, ""we agreed to settle this matter with one important condition – that the attorney general’s office agree as part of the settlement that there is no admission of wrongdoing by district dogs whatsoever."" the dog daycare and boarding company also thanked its employees and customers for their support. in addition to the settlement,eight pet owners are suing district dogs, alleging gross negligence, recklessness, and deliberate indifference by the business. the lawsuit is ongoing. the investigation by the attorney general's office revealed that district dogs misled customers about the risks of flooding, despite internal concerns about the facility’s safety. the company failed to develop proper emergency procedures, including an evacuation plan, and did not train employees to respond to such emergencies. under the settlement terms, district dogs has 90 days to implement its new emergency response procedures and train staff at all d.c. locations. read the full settlement agreement below:"

ouc oversight roundtable hearing focuses on dc’s embattled 911 call center,"washington, d.c.’s embattled 911 call center is in the hot seat again and is expected to be the focus of an oversight roundtable hearing tuesday. the hearing comes after several high-profile response issues including the death of a five-year-old and delays to advanced medical help when the baby's parents called for help.","September 30, 2024 6:01pm EDT","washington-washington, d.c.’s embattled 911 call center is in the hot seat again and is expected to be the focus of an oversight roundtable hearing tuesday. the hearing comes after several high-profile response issues including the death of a five-month-old and delays to advanced medical help when the baby's parents called for help. the head of the d.c. council judiciary committee will be bringing in witnesses and officials to question what happened leading to some of these serious incidents and what’s being done to address them. the office of unified command, or ouc, is the agency that operates the city’s 911 call center. fox 5 has been reporting on issues within this very important public safety agency for years. on the agenda for monday’s oversight roundtable, the judiciary is planning to ask questions about staffing shortages, possible blown addresses, delays in emergency response arrival and technological failures. last week, ouc deputy director heather mcgaffin defended the agency. ""911 in washington, d.c. is not in crisis,"" mcgaffin, told fox 5. ""it's an overtaxed system. we took 1.8 million calls. that far outpaces any other state in the nation per capita. and we are doing things, making improvements, to keep up with that pacing."" judiciary committee chair councilmember brook pinto recently introduced legislation trying to bring more transparency to the agency and said she’d be holding monthly oversight roundtables along with unannounced visits to the 911 call center. the discussion went on for hours and is just the first in a series of oversight hearings questioning issues and incidents within the office of unified communications. ward 2 councilmember brooke pinto, who recently introduced thetransparency in emergency response act of 2024, has been making biweekly unannounced visits to the call center. last saturday night, she said she found only one call taker for all ems emergencies in the district of columbia - well below the required minimum of six. ""when i talk about the need to focus on staffing, it is not just a nice-to-have - it is an absolutely must-have focus for this agency,"" pinto said to fox 5's homa bash following the hearing. pinto said they heard about improvements that have been made or are underway but will continue to push throughout the fall and into next year to ensure they are implemented. ""we hear from district residents about concerns when it comes to your safety, ensuring your 911 call center is fast, is accurate and is transparent, and i am going to work every day to make sure it lives up to that promise,"" pinto added. last week, ouc director heather mcgaffin said the call center isn't in crisis but is overtaxed. ward 6 councilmember charles allen said he disagrees. ""i think we have an agency that's been in crisis,"" allen said. ""i think that we have one that has not been able to acknowledge the failures and problems and the first step to fixing something is to acknowledge there's a problem and they rarely will even acknowledge that."" according to mcgaffin, dispatch took in 1.8 million calls, which is the highest volume in the nation per capita. to get workers in the door - ouc has been offering a $2500 hiring bonus. in addition, they've also offered an $800 monthly bonus to employees who do not call out for shifts – 94 workers received that bonus in august. still - allen said they haven't seen a difference yet - recounting a story of someone recently who saw a fire start and ran to a fire station rather than trusting 911 to respond. ""that's where people are and they've got to understand the urgency and lack of confidence people have in the 911 center right now,"" allen said, adding that they need a cultural change in leadership and dogged oversight. ""hearing rosy assessments and 'it's just we're right around the bend, things are gonna get better' - we've been hearing that for years and it's not there yet."" in october, 31 new trainees will start at ouc, but there will still be 20 vacancies. pinto had concerns about those vacancies and raising the full-time staffing numbers above those levels. mcgaffin said they calculate minimum staffing levels by using data from call volume, call length, call wrap-ups, and notes plus breaks. ""this is a really tough job, and it gets a lot of attention and maybe not always in a positive manner so the things that are happening shouldn't fall on the shoulders of the people who work there,"" mcgaffin said. ""really what we are working toward is that people will always get their calls answered without a queue, which is lofty, but we believe we can get there,"" said deputy mayor lindsey appiah. the district has released a 22-point action plan aimed at tackling dispatch issues, including tech upgrades and staffing issues. these d.c. council oversight hearings will continue monthly."

whistleblower claims special police officers are working in dc without licenses,"are there fake special police officers working in washington, d.c.?","September 27, 2024 9:57pm EDT","washington-are there fake special police officers working in washington, d.c.? fox 5 has been checking with various officials on the matter after multiple whistleblowers and concerned community members raised these concerns with fox 5. one whistleblower who asked not to be identified, spoke on camera, alleging they were hired to work security at the columbia heights village apartment complex, and named two companies that are not legally licensed to operate in the district. the whistleblower named one company as ""off duty protection,"" claiming this company was an alleged subsidiary of ""usea protective services, llc."" the whistleblower says they left after learning of alleged legal issues. this whistleblower is an actual licensed spo, who claims one of the owners was working as an armed spo at the columbia height village apartment complex and others without a legal spo license. ""i saw a lot of unethical processes or procedures such as the use of excessive force – essentially kidnapping. because if someone is not a law enforcement officer, and they’re processing arresting people, that is kidnapping,"" the whistleblower said. in the district, special police officers are essentially private officers hired to work security. they have similar powers to d.c. police, but those powers normally only extend to the property they’re protecting. when fox 5 reached out to management offices for the columbia heights village apartment complex regarding the claims against both companies, we received this response from spokesperson ed cafasso via email: ""columbia heights village became aware of the company's licensing issues on april 23, 2024. their contract to provide security to the community was terminated the next day, on april 24, 2024. their contract to provide security on the property began november 20, 2023."" cafasso would not name the company columbia heights village held the contract with. he did confirm that a fake insurance certificate was used to obtain the contract and that they are currently working with a new security company, now identified as, pchange protective services. the whistleblower who went on record told fox 5 they filed claims with the dc office of the attorney general, the ftc, and the department of labor – also alleging that more than one spo performed the security work but was not paid for their services. d.c. police tell fox 5 they are still investigating serious allegations made. usea protective services, llc last held a license with d.c. in 2017, according to a city license search. the city’s department of licensing and consumer protection spokesperson charles basham iii wrote in one of multiple emails previously sent to fox 5: ""the department of licensing and consumer protection (dlcp) aims to ensure all business entities in the district maintain accurate and up-to-date licenses. off duty protection is currently not a registered or licensed agency in the district. on june 6, 2024, a complaint concerning off duty protection was lodged with our agency; our policy is not to comment on matters under review."" since airing a september 27th report, fox 5 was contacted by the man who claims to be the owner of ""off duty protection."" he says his company was never affiliated with usea’s contract and is denying having any part with any of the allegations made involving columbia heights village or their security contact. separately, fox 5 asked john ayala, a long-time licensed d.c. spo license and conceal carry instructor for the city, about the matter regarding concerns raised. ayala responded that he was not surprised. ayala owns his own security company, archangel security and training. he said there are likely more spos than current police officers working in d.c. and that he feels there needs to be more individual responsibility. ""that’s concerning because if they go out here and make an arrest and hurt somebody, then the city might even get sued, besides that person. so we have to, the companies themselves have to make sure if they’re going to hire people, they have to make sure they’re fully licensed. you can’t just bring them in because they want a body – and that’s what happens a lot of time,"" ayala said in part of his conversation with fox 5. ayala says he warns his students to stay away from any security companies that require the spo to have their own (personal) firearm because that’s not allowed in d.c. anyone can look up a license status on the district’s professional license search pagehere. whether there are any safeguards to prevent non-licensed contracts or non-licensed spos from operating, fox 5 learned mpd has a very small branch that responds to spo matters, when requested to do so. that branch is called the security officers management branch or somb. d.c. police told fox 5 there’s no real entity that patrols these issues – and that this is something they’re now working on with the city’s licensing department as the investigation into what happened at the columbia heights village apartment complex continues. this is a developing story. check back with fox 5 for updates."

""i do think judges think pretty hard about their decisions. and we don’t have, unfortunately, crystal balls. sometimes we do take chances on people, and if we didn’t, we would always err on the side of locking people up no matter what,"" she stated. throughout her tenure, josey-herring faced significant public criticism of the court system, including remarks from mayor muriel bowser and u.s. attorney matthew graves, who suggested that the court contributed to d.c.’s rising crime rates. josey-herring had to navigate increasing criminal caseloads amid the pandemic and deal with double-digit judicial vacancies, which forced some judges to take on twice their usual workloads. in 2021, bowser labeled the court a bottleneck when discussing the issue of rising crime, while graves indicated that sentencing was too lenient. josey-herring’s public rebuttals to these criticisms are unusual for a sitting judge, highlighting her commitment to the judiciary's integrity. as she prepares to pass the leadership to judge milton lee, josey-herring participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony wednesday for a new addition to the courthouse. despite the new space, the need for more judges remains critical. when she departs next week, there will be nine vacant seats on the superior court bench. josey-herring also touched upon whether judges share some responsibility for the rising crime rates in the district.more details from that conversation will be featured later this week on fox 5's ""in the courts."""

""i created this bill with columbia heights in mind because it's a really vibrant area in a commercial corridor with a lot of residential around it. so residents in that area are often struggling with how to balance those two things,""  nadeau said.

""i myself have installed soundproofing on my bedroom windows because of this issue,"" one columbia heights neighbor told fox 5. ""it's a start but it doesn't do everything."" the bill would also create more coordination between agencies that do sound enforcement.

dc lawmakers once again take aim at illegal weed businesses,"lawmakers in washington, d.c. are cracking down on illegal weed businesses that have been operating unlicensed for years.","September 18, 2024 6:34pm EDT","washington-lawmakers in washington, d.c. are cracking down on illegal weed businesses that have been operating unlicensed for years. on wednesday, two more shops were shut down as part of new enforcement: all american papers on 504 h street ne) and stonerz dc on 521 h street ne. ""this is a serious problem. we have public safety problems that often go along with these businesses. they are operating illegally so you have to have standard enforcement and go after them,"" said ward 6 councilmember charles allen. allen introduced and led d.c. council to pass the medical cannabis program enforcement emergency amendment act of 2024in january of this yearto grant abca the legal authority to enforce against illegally operating businesses. ""we want to create a legal, well-regulated marketplace. congress prevents us from doing that so we have a lot of workarounds,"" allen explained. essentially, the law gives the metropolitan police department (mpd) and abca — the alcoholic beverage and cannabis administration — more power to shut down unlicensed illegal weed shops that lawmakers say are interfering with d.c.'s legal medicinal marijuana businesses. the businesses are first given warnings, then cease and desist letters and if they continue to operate illegally, they will get padlocked. the process from violation to closure can take months, and businesses are given a pathway to become licensed and operate legally. the first illegal cannabis business shut down, on september 5th, was supreme terpene onu street. police seized a large amount of illegal pot, edibles, thc products and psychedelic mushrooms. the second closure was the green cloud shop on 7th and kennedy st. in northwest d.c. on september 13th, which officials said had received warnings starting in march. the store owner, 49-year-old abdelhak hamsasse, was arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute and operating a business after the certificate of authority had been revoked. to date, abca has issued 23 cease and desist orders and 79 written warning letters to illegal weed stores. retailers will also not be able to operate legal cannabis stores close to a daycare if the daycare decides to object. if you aren't familiar, the unregulated so-called i-71 shops typically work this way: you buy an item, then they gift you marijuana, as a sort of loophole and thishas been going on for years. allen said that the point, the d.c. council wants to get across is that there is a legal cannabis marketplace in the district that is safe for people. ""if you're looking to consume cannabis, you can have confidence in what you're purchasing at a licensed retailer. you can't do that at an illegal shop. we're seeing these illegal shops that have fentanyl-laced in marijuana they're selling, amphetamines, other drugs,"" allen added. ""it's dangerous stuff. they're undercutting the legal businesses but they're also putting our residents and consumers at risk and that's another reason enforcement has got to happen."" below is a statement from ward 3 councilmember matthew frumin: ""in recent years, unregulated and unsafe ""gifting"" shops have emerged across the district, exploiting loopholes to ""gift"" cannabis when a consumer purchases other merchandise. the legislation we advanced on tuesday gives abca more authority to shut down these gifting shops, while allowing the heavily regulated medical cannabis industry to operate. these gifting shops operating outside the regulated market can make it harder for legal medicinal cannabis shops to do business and can put our residents in danger. last year in ward 3, a group of elementary school students ate gummies containing thc, leading to hospital visits. it would be hard to more dramatically illustrate the need to move from an unregulated to a regulated market. we must close the gifting shops as soon as possible and allow regulated medical cannabis shops to operate with proper processes and oversight."""

70% were registered in another state. · most stops were resolved without any physical contact between the officer and the person stopped or his or her property. only 10% of stops involved a protective pat down or a pre-arrest search of either a person or property. · mpd stops play a vital role in supporting vision zero and making our streets safe for all users. fifty-eight percent of all stops result in a ticket. of these, almost one-third of the tickets were warning tickets. eleven percent of arrests include a charge for a criminal traffic violation. · most stops are for traffic violations and have nothing to do with gun or gun crimes, but some stops help remove a significant number of guns from our neighborhoods. in 2023, mpd officers were able to remove 2,057 guns—64% of all guns recovered—from dc streets as a result of police stops.[1] · most stops are brief. more than three out of four were resolved in about 15 minutes; 86% lasted 30 minutes or less. the department says it is committed to fair, professional, and constitutional policing in all aspects of its work as it strives to safeguard people and property in the district of columbia. the department works continuously to strengthen its service to the city. in the past year, the department has focused on providing updated and comprehensive training for all its officers on the fourth amendment, including 10 hours of online and classroom training developed in partnership with the us attorney for the district of columbia. the department is also supporting an independent study on equity in traffic stops conducted by the university of connecticut institute for municipal and regional policy. researchers regularly stress that disparities, in and of themselves, are not sufficient evidence of racial profiling. we expect this study to be available in fiscal year 2025. read the full report below: editor's note: this story originally said that african american individuals in d.c. had a police encounter every ten minutes. the aclu corrected their original statement to clarify that the report showed that one person in the district was stopped every ten minutes. the story has been updated to accurately reflect the report."

""we are heartbroken that some young people would do this to our brother,"" malda said, adding that she believes the teens should be charged as adults. ""unfortunately the law does not stipulate that they can be but that’s what we want as a family,"" she said. prosecutors say when the murder made the news two days after brown was killed, the girls tried to delete the evidence, including instagram messages, and tried to get their story straight. one of the defense attorneys says what happened to brown is absolutely horrible but that his client did not kill him and that there was no conspiracy with others to commit a murder. one of the five girls charged in this case has already struck a plea deal. the other two are scheduled to go on trial in november."

""i'm anxious to get more details to understand what the situation is,"" mendelson told fox 5. ""you all know as much as i know."" in march,reports emerged that the d.c. office of campaign finance levied a $20,000 fine against white and his campaign treasurer. on top of that, ocf said white owed nearly $59,000 in public funds he received through d.c.’s fair elections program, a relatively new program where candidates can be eligible for some public financing. white has utilized the fair elections program in the last two election cycles, including his 2022 mayoral campaign. ocf has noted some issues with the reporting. since 2020, white’s campaign has had to file several amended reports with ocf. in a subsequent civil filing, white said he was unaware of these issues, and seemed to lay much of the blame on that campaign’s treasurer. the treasurer spoke to fox 5 back in march, and she said that all the requirements were a lot and she’s worked to remedy the situation. fox 5 was able to ask white about the missing $59,000 in campaign funds in march. white said at the time he was working with his attorney and his accountant to try and figure out exactly what happened. in 2018, white ignited a firestorm by posting a short video on his facebook page claiming that an unexpected snowfall was because of ""the rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters."" fellow council members and jewish community leaders accused white of spreading an anti-semitic conspiracy theory about jewish control of world events. the rothschilds, a prominent jewish family whose banking dynasty dates back to the 18th century, are a frequent target of global conspiracy theories. white at the time said he was unaware the rothschild theory could be construed as anti-semitic. the first-term african-american council member reached out to try to mend fences. he attended a passover seder and met with jewish community leaders for breakfast over bagels and lox. he went on a guided tour of the u.s. holocaust memorial museum but abruptly left halfway through without explanation. then video surfaced from a meeting of top city officials that showed white floating a similar conspiracy during an innocuous presentation about the university of the district of columbia. white posed a question centered on the claim that the rothschilds controlled both the world bank and the federal government. the video shows city leaders in the room, including mayor muriel bowser, awkwardly laughing it off and moving on, but the footage further upset jewish community leaders. then a further revelation: white had contributed $500 from a fund meant for his ward 8 constituents to a chicago event for louis farrakhan, leader of the nation of islam. farrakhan and the nation of islam have a decades-old history of overtly anti-semitic rhetoric. the nation of islam also does significant social and charitable work in black communities and retains some respect among those who don’t share its views. ""i sincerely think he was just repeating conspiracy theories he had heard somewhere,"" said rabbi batya glazer, who had met with white on the issue. ""it does mean he has an obligation to clarify what his position is."" marion barry, the late former mayor of the district of columbia, endorsed white in both the 2011 board of education special election and the 2012 general election. white has long been considered one of barry's proteges. barry served four terms as the mayor of the district of columbia and 16 years on the city council before he passed away in nov. 2014 at the age of 78. he's known as d.c.'s ""mayor for life,"" and faced his own share of scandal from his 1990 arrest after being caught on videotape smoking crack cocaine. ""i'm not marion barry, i'm trayon white. and i want to be everything god created me to be,"" white said in an interview with fox 5 in 2016. ""i think we're in a great place that brings that energy that marion barry had, that people believe in me, trust me and are behind me."" barry served as the ward 8 councilmember until his death in 2014 – after which white ran twice for the seat and won on his second attempt. while barry was a d.c. transplant, white is from ward 8 and has been outspoken throughout his time in office on violent crime in his community. the associated press contributed to this report."

""that’s not what i said. we want to make sure the security measures were handled appropriately,"" chief smith stated. restaurant owner rick allison attended thursday's meeting and apologized for not putting away the chairs. he emphasized that the restaurant is cooperating with police by providing security camera footage and other information. residents at the meeting expressed frustration over ongoing crime issues on m street. police data and resident reports indicate a surge in criminal activity, including shootings, assaults, and carjackings, near a specific apartment building on m street since the beginning of 2024. residents criticized police for what they perceive as a lack of proactive engagement, noting that officers often remain in their cars. chief smith responded by pledging to increase police presence on foot and bike patrols to build stronger community relationships. ""if we are sitting in cars in communities all the time, then we are not building those relationships,"" she said. ""i do know that there are some officers on foot and bike patrol, but we want to make sure that is transferred to the entire district."" anyone with information about the shooting is urged to contact police or leave an anonymous tip."

""you have been instrumental when there have been activities or incidents that have taken place in the district of columbia. you have been instrumental and giving us amazing tips. we need in order to solve crimes and also to deal with suspicious activity. understand that you are the pillar, a public safety here in our community."" mpd held events across all of the city’s seven police districts with a number of activities at each one. over in prince george’s county, police and people of all ages come together for a positive interaction. ""i think it’s good that they’re doing it so people that don’t get out the house, can come out the house and have fun and meet new people,"" said cytrys smith, a resident of prince george’s county. police had their helicopter guardian there the swat team’s bearcat and the department’s marine unit for everyone to check out. ""our number one reason why we’re successful is because of the community,"" pgpd police chief malik aziz told fox 5. while data does show crime is down. chief malik aziz realizes that’s not always how people feel. ""how people feel is real. just as real as any stat could ever be. if you feel like your neighborhood is safe, it’s safe. if you feel like it’s not safe, no matter what stats say then it’s not safe,"" he said. that’s why he believes it’s so important to be in the neighborhoods they serve. the goal is to help shape and change perceptions – not just about violence but also about the characteristics of those in uniform. ""some people just think that all police are bad and it’s not like that,"" prince george’s county resident patricia mitchell said. ""i don’t think police are a bad thing. i think they help people, save lives,"" neighbor maya waters added. prince george’s county council vice chair sydney harrison says it’s gatherings like this that help us realize we’re more alike than different.

american university student charged with voyeurism after allegedly filming man in bathroom,an american university student is facing charges for secretly recording someone in the bathroom and fox 5 has learned that the suspect was also reported missing just days after the alleged incident.,"August 6, 2024 11:38pm EDT","washington-an american university student is facing charges for secretly recording someone in the bathroom and fox 5 has learned that the suspect was also reported missing just days after the alleged incident. american university police say the peeping incident happened two weeks ago on july 22 in a bathroom at the library. the student accused of recording is 19-year-old kris emmanuel estrada. according to court documents estrada used his cell phone to record a man using the restroom in the stall next to him. ""peeping toms are gross,"" au senior taylor murray said. disgust and frustration are what american university students are feeling after learning about the recent arrest of 19-year-old student kris emmanuel estrada. according to the charging documents, on july 22, a man using the restroom on the second floor of bender library caught someone recording him from the stall next door. the man left the restroom and reported the incident to university police giving them a description of the suspect's shoes. through surveillance cameras and student id card access records, police were able to identify estrada as their suspect. several days later police obtained a warrant to search estrada’s dorm room at constitution hall. police confiscated his phone and when they went through it, they found seven recently deleted videos from july 22 of a man who matched the victim's toilet. while students are glad the suspect was caught, some are upset about the way the school handled the incident. ""it’s crazy that they didn’t tell us about it,"" murray said. in a statement to fox 5 dc, american university says ""on july 22, a voyeurism incident was reported to aupd, which launched an immediate investigation. through this investigation, a student was identified as a suspect and arrested last week."" murray and other students tell us they found out that estrada is facing a voyeurism charge through the student-led paper and not an email or message from school leaders. ""the real frustration is the way we find out about these instances is through other students,"" recent american university graduate amanda carroll said. ""the eagle is a student-run paper and it’s frustrating not to see something come from the university itself."" students who spoke with fox 5 did point out that estrada was reported missing last week. friends and family shared this poster. according to the university, he was safely located and turned himself in. ""it’s unacceptable and shouldn’t be happening on our campus or any campus,"" murray said. fox 5 is told that estrada was registered for summer classes and that’s why he was on campus. but this isn’t the first time a ""voyeurism"" incident was reported on campus. back in april, a student was suspended and barred from campus after peeping at one of the residence halls, and a similar situation happened last year. ""it’s not only just this situation and the three instances but there’s also been instances in the dorms and no accountability or communication,"" murray said. in a statement, the university said that ""voyeurism — like all other crimes — is unacceptable on our campus."" estrada did appear before a judge where he pleaded not guilty. his next court date is in september."
dc area police departments to host national night out tuesday,"on tuesday, police departments across the entire greater d.c. region will be hosting events to bond with the communities for this year’s national night out.","August 6, 2024 12:34pm EDT","washington-on tuesday, police departments across the entire greater d.c. region will be hosting events to bond with the communities for this year’s national night out. maryland state police d.c. police prince george’s county police montgomery county police arlington county police virginia state police fairfax county police prince william county police national night out 2024 comes after a deadly year last year, with most of the region seeing both homicides and total violent spike – and it’s not exactly over. in prince george’s county, for example, carjackings are down. however,homicides and total violent crime stats are up. in neighboring washington d.c., the district ended 2023 with a nearly two-decade high number of murders: 274. this year, the city’s seen at least 114 murders. dc’s elected leaders have been echoing that while there have been over 100 so far this year, the number of homicides is actually down 29% so far this year compared to the same time last year. total violent crime is down 35% according to tuesday’s d.c. police stats. fox 5 asked about what type of complications d.c. police are still seeing when it comes to youth engaged in crime, especially, and how police hope national night out will help address this. ""i don’t think that we’re having complications,"" said mpd assistant chief andre wright, ""i think the fact that crime is trending down significantly is due in large part to our communications with the community. and that’s one of the things we get to highlight on [national night out] – talk about how people are feeling due to the open challenges of communication. and also to discuss things that we can do differently and places that we need to pivot, based on what the community as a whole, at large, has seen. so i definitely understand your question, but i think that -- that our relationship with the public and our specific community, i think, is as better as i’ve seen it in years."" fox 5 also spoke with area community activist jay brown, who operates under the effort called, ""community shoulders."" brown’s work includes trying to facilitate conversations between the d.c. community and city leadership. ""we have had a two-year-old shot. we had the double homicide just over the weekend. anytime an official,  the mayor, the chief of police, lindsay appiah, the deputy mayor of public safety say crime is down, you’re disrespecting the victims of crimes that we’ve had this year. you’re disrespecting the families of those victims,"" said brown. ""i hope during these events, that there are some honest conversations that extend beyond [national night out]. some honest conversations about what works for ‘this’ specific community ‘this’ specific area.""both with different perspectives, both men also agree important conversations need to be had – hoping it will happen on national night out. do the families and children who actually need help – and who the police hope to meet with – actually participate? fox 5 spoke with beverly smith, a leader of the group, ""voices of black mothers united."" she’s also the founder of  ""mammas safe haven,"" which reaches out to the families of crime victims.  smith tells fox 5 while she understands the skepticism, she believes national night out is very important. ""i’m excited that it happens in the summertime because, unfortunately, crime is higher in the summertime, and i think it’s most important during this time because our youth are out in the community, and it gives them an opportunity to see police in a better light, other than just seeing them show up when something’s going wrong,"" said smith, ""i think it really leans a lot on the community organizations. community organizations like – i have a community organization, ‘mamama’s safe haven,’ we bring our youth out. so it’s really in partnership. so that’s the great thing about it, it really shows the strength in partnerships with the community and the police department, because the community organizations bring the youth out and then shares the information with families."" smith believes the mindset around reporting crimes and working together needs to change in order to truly address crime. she’s also planning to award the d.c. police, telling fox 5 chief pamela a. smith has brought a human face to the department. one change chief smith gets credit for from activists and other members of her department, is the community walks she’s instituted, allowing those who may not be able to attend a community meeting a chance to still meet authorities and have their concerns heard. assistant chief wright tells fox 5 national night out is just as important to the officers, as it is to the community members. ""the officers are excited. you know, obviously, being a police officer, sometimes we have the unfortunate event to show up in neighborhoods in some of the worst times that people are having and so they see us a lot in that regards. but we crave the opportunity to also show up in a positive light when it’s not a tragic,"" he said."

""he told me he’s going to a halfway house. he didn’t say where, but he said he’ll get back with me. when i spoke to him, he was in the airport, getting ready to get on another plane,"" parker said. a video circulating on social media purportedly shows the now 59-year-old edmond at an airport shortly after his release, saying to the camera, ""i’m back better than ever.""

9/11 plotters reach plea deal over 20 years after the deadliest terrorist attack on u.s. soil,the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks and two of his accomplices have reached a plea deal over two decades after the deadliest terrorist attack on united states soil.,"August 1, 2024 3:51pm EDT","washington-the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks and two of his accomplices have reached a plea deal over two decades after the deadliest terrorist attack on united states soil. all three men have been in u.s. custody since 2003, spending time at guantánamo and other overseas prisons. khalid sheikh mohammed and his two accomplices, walid bin attash and mustafa al-hawsawi, have agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. the plea agreement avoids what would have been a lengthy and complicated death penalty trial against mohammed. this deal comes more than 20 years after the al-qaeda attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. militants of the organization hijacked four commercial airliners and crashed two planes into the twin towers in new york city and a third into the pentagon. the fourth plane was headed toward washington, d.c. when passengers attempted to interfere, causing the plane to crash in a pennsylvania field. executive director of the american civil liberties union, anthony d. romero, argued that the plea agreement was both the only and justified option. ""it’s also the only practical solution after nearly two decades of litigation,"" said romero. ""for too long, the u.s. has repeatedly defended its use of torture and unconstitutional military tribunals at guantánamo bay. the military commissions were doomed from the start and the government’s torture of these defendants makes this plea both necessary and just. finally, closing the chapter on these cases with a plea agreement will also provide a measure of transparency and justice for 9/11 family members."" but the families of september 11th victims feel differently.

trump assassination attempt: senators grill the secret service’s communication and drone failures in butler,"the head of the u.s. secret service and fbi were grilled by senators about the attempted assassination of former president trump at a campaign rally in butler, pennsylvania.","July 30, 2024 3:53pm EDT","washington-the head of the u.s. secret service and fbi were grilled by senators about the attempted assassination of former president trump at a campaign rally in butler, pennsylvania. members of the senate judiciary committee and the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee questioned fbi deputy director paul abbate and secret service acting director ronald rowe on the security failures that took place on july 13th. ""i am still shocked how a 20-year-old loner could outsmart two of the most established federal agencies. and almost pull it off,"" senator tom carper said, summing up what many in the room were thinking. one of the major flaws discussed: the secret service’s drone was not operational at the rally site. the acting director attributed the drone issues to the rocky cell service in the area surrounding the rally. ""communication that day at the butler rally site was challenging,"" rowe said. ""this day, in particular, there was a connectivity problem."" ""faulty connectivity"" kept the secret service’s drone out of operation until 5 pm. senator mike lee from utah explicitly asked rowe why the shooter’s drone could fly despite poor service, but the secret service’s drone did not. rowe could provide an answer. if the drone was active and surveying the rally grounds, it would have detected the shooter’s drone and alerted the secret service of the potential threat. ""we could have perhaps found him,"" rowe said. ""maybe even stopped him before."" senator chuck grassley of iowa expressed serious concern about why such an advanced federal agency depends on local cell service. other grave flaws were picked apart by senators, including the communication and planning between local law enforcement and the secret service. ""we did have a meeting in the days leading up to the event to assess any potential threats. the focus is to coordinate times for walk-throughs. those walk-through assessments of the butler site did happen,"" abbate said. local law enforcement was stationed inside of the agr building which crooks climbed on top of. a whistleblower claimed that police were supposed to be stationed on the roof of the building, but it got too hot and they went down. rowe said he heard the same claims but did not confirm it. senator lee asked rowe why local law enforcement officers covered the agr building, a location that should have been covered by the secret service when the individuals did not meet the qualifications to work for the agency. lee emphasized that a decision like this is ""lethal."" rowe stated that information about an active shooter ""stayed within state and local enforcement and did not get passed to the secret service."" this raised many questions in the senate about whether any communication mechanisms exist to connect all layers of security at these kinds of events. questions spiraled among the senate regarding why the shooter’s use of a range finder did not alter his classification from just a suspicious person to a serious threat. rowe argued that ""a suspicious person turns to a threat when there is a weapon involved."" ignoring the suspicion that a range finder would only have been useful to someone who had a weapon and planned to use it. senators criticized the secrecy of the secret service and suggested they speak directly to the press to avoid conspiracies and the spread of false information. they argued for more frequent and public information releases. ""you guys are a black hole,"" said senator ted cruz. ""you’re making the federal government look bad, and you’re losing the trust of the american people. you need to commit to talking to the press."" senator ron johnson said that the transparency of the july 13th events will be unveiled to the public. ""we need to find out literally second by second what happened, so the american public knows what happened,"" said johnson."

""the defense of democracy is more important than any title,"" biden said. ""nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. and that includes personal ambition."" both biden and harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned trump by name. ""the great thing about america is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,"" biden said. ""the people do. history is in your hands. the power is in your hands. the idea of america — lies in your hands."" biden’s candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from democrats after his abysmal debate against trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor’s attacks. it sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating trump in november, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job. biden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party’s political elites and from ordinary voters. on sunday afternoon, while isolating at his rehoboth beach, delaware, home with covid-19, biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on x announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of harris. ""i have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,"" biden said, saying he wanted to make room for ""fresh voices, yes, younger voices."" he added, ""that is the best way to unite our nation."" biden’s address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. he pledged to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between israel and hamas in gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for supreme court reform. biden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with harris’ electoral result in november, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the biden administration. his advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself. harris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office. biden, aides say, knows that if harris loses, he’ll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against trump. if she wins, she’ll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he’ll be remembered for a washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership. you can watch the speech on air, on ourlive streamor onfox local. don't have the fox local app? here's how you candownloadit. the associated press contributed to this report."

""once the settlement became public, there’s been an outpouring. it struck a chord with people who read about it. we are receiving a lot of tips, and i think that’s a good sign. it shows that there is a widespread problem."" the settlement requires swahili village dc and onyona to change their practices and report on compliance for three years, ensuring adherence to all district wage and hour laws. as part of the settlement, swahili village and onyona must also cover the costs of a claims administrator selected by the district to locate and notify eligible workers and distribute the owed funds. in a statement, the fine-dining african restaurant said, ""swahili village is pleased to report that it has reached a no-fault settlement agreement with the district of columbia. this agreement ensures business continuity and solidifies our ongoing commitment to serving our customers with excellence while ensuring the best interests of our staff and other stakeholders remain paramount. on august 22, 2023, the district filed a complaint relating to certain labor practices. the period under dispute was during the covid-19 public health emergency, an unprecedented time that challenged restaurant operational systems globally. our d.c. location, which opened just weeks before the covid-19 public health emergency faced unprecedented challenges as the city shut down on march 11, 2020. being a newly opened establishment, swahili village did not qualify for any government assistance during the pandemic. despite these hardships, many of our workers volunteered to help keep the business running, demonstrating their dedication and commitment. ""while in no way admitting wrongdoing, we welcome the end of the matter and confirm we will adhere strictly to the agreement. we insist our workers are allowed to be part of our growth story. our staff is critical to our success, and their well-being is our priority,"" says kevin onyana, founder of the swahili village authentic chain of restaurants. during the public health emergency, swahili village supported the community by feeding first responders, including firemen, police, ems, nurses, and doctors. our commitment to service has always extended beyond our restaurant doors, emphasizing our role in the community. this is an enduring commitment that continues to be part of who we are and how we do business."""

""he was a good, loving person,"" said isa freeling, zack’s aunt. zack’s mother died of cancer, and his brother and father died by suicide.  at 26, freeling was the last surviving member of his immediate family.  in conversations with freeling before he died, family says he was feeling good about his life, was excited to start a food truck around d.c., and was determined not to let his life be defined by the tragedy that surrounded him. on the evening of october 18, 2021, his roommate called 9-1-1 from their quincy place northeast townhouse, saying freeling had a gunshot wound. isa freeling and her husband bruce weiss, zack’s uncle, felt more urgency was needed during the initial stages of the investigation.  the medical examiner eventually determined the manner of death as undetermined, and freeling and weiss knew that couldn’t have been right. read more: 'nobody believes it was a suicide': family searches for answers in dc man's death freeling and weiss say they did their own investigations and hired private investigators that generated more information that pointed towards freeling’s death being a homicide. they met with police and the d.c. medical examiner frequently.  they felt they had an ally in the medical examiner, who they say vowed to continue looking at this case. though, they were frustrated with the pace of the investigation; citing police workload and issues with accreditation at the crime lab.

(fox 5 dc)-the washington metropolitan area is experiencing a dangerous heatwave, prompting warnings and precautions from officials. currently, the area is on its third consecutive day of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees — which hasn't been done since the 1930s. tuesday's record high reached 104 degrees, making it the hottest day yet. the last time we reached 104 degrees in july was twice in 2012. it's only the fourth time since the turn of the century it's been this hot. the current heat is the top weather-related killer year-round, surpassing even tornadoes and hurricanes in terms of fatalities. the region is also facing a significant need for rain. the term ""flash drought"" has been used to describe the unusual dry conditions that typically don’t occur at this time of year. normally, daily thunderstorms provide relief, but this year has been exceptionally hot and dry. the temperature at 3 p.m. was still a scorching 103 degrees, with a dew point of 66, making it feel like 108 degrees. the southwest winds provided little relief, and warnings remain in place to limit outdoor activities until sunset. temperatures across the region have been extreme, with baltimore at 103 degrees, annapolis at 92, quantico at 99, dulles at 100, and frederick at 91. a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued as a precaution due to the potential for sudden, strong storms. tuesday's storms developed quickly and became very strong. tuesday, we’ve seen some small storms that haven’t amounted to much, but there’s still a lot of potential energy in the atmosphere. severe thunderstorm watches have been extended up to upstate new york and new england. on monday, chicago experienced significant weather with a derecho event. this extreme heat can lead to extreme storms, which are anticipated for wednesday. wednesday is expected to remain hot and humid, with temperatures around 100 degrees and a high heat index, leading to a heat advisory. strong thunderstorms are also possible wednesday along a cold front, according to fox 5's weather team. this will make it feel much better by thursday and friday, but before we get there, we’ll likely deal with severe weather on wednesday evening. we’re looking at a very hot, very humid wednesday. the severe risk is higher and more widespread along the i-95 corridor. isolated storms tuesday evening should end by sunset, but wednesday could bring a squall line with damaging winds, hail, and heavy rain. the storm system is expected to move in from the mountains by late afternoon, reaching the i-95 corridor by evening. rainfall amounts could be substantial, with some areas receiving over two inches. this much-needed rain will come quickly, but relief is on the way."

""i’m a never trump guy,"" vance said in an interview with charlie rose in 2016. ""i never liked him."" the ohio native harshly denounced trump on twitter during his 2016 campaign, calling him a ""moral disaster"" and ""just another opioid"" for middle america. vance also liked tweets that said trump committed ""serial sexual assault,"" called him ""one of the usa’s most hated, villainous, duchy celebs,"" and harshly criticized trump’s response to the 2017 white nationalist rally in charlottesville, virginia. trump’s vice presidential announcement on monday marks a dramatic reversal on vance’s part. the ""hillbilly elegy"" author was launched into the political spotlight due to his ability to explain trump’s appeal to the white working class. the 39-year-old’s memoir, published the year trump was elected, covered the childhood years he spent in jackson, kentucky, raised by his ""mamaw"" and ""papaw"" as his mother battled drug addiction. in a 2016 interview about his book, vance told a reporter that although his background would have made him a natural trump supporter, ""i’m definitely not gonna vote for trump because i think that he’s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains. he is the most raw expression of a massive finger pointed at other people."" since aligning himself with trump, vance too has begun to point a finger at outside sources such as offshoring and immigration. vance wrote privately on facebook in 2016 to his former law school roommate, josh mclaurin, that he ""goes back and forth between thinking trump is a cynical asshole like nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s america’s hitler."" ""to go from those texts…to being trump’s biggest cheerleader, it’s just kind of unbelievable,"" mclaurin told bbc newshour. if donald trump clinches victory in november, his outspoken critic will be his second in command. vance recast himself as one of trump’s staunchest maga allies over 18 months in the senate after winning a 2022 race for an open seat in ohio.  he demonstrated the utmost loyalty to the former president and downplayed the events of the jan. 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol. trump’s vice presidential selection could be a turn-off for some voters regarding his position on abortion, foreign affairs, and immigration. as a senator, vance was known for his ""america first"" skepticism of the u.s. involvement in global affairs such as the war in ukraine. republicans who favor robust u.s. involvement concerning shaping world affairs may take a hit if vance ascends to the role of vice president. vance has been a leading opponent of u.s. aid to ukraine and argues that defense against china should be prioritized. ""i don’t really care what happens to ukraine one way or another,"" vance said earlier this year in an interview on steve bannon’s war room podcast. conservative female voters may be deterred by vance’s harsh abortion views. he has articulated harder-line policies than donald trump, who argues that abortion policies should be up to the states. vance strongly opposes the practice and could even support a national ban. vance will reiterate trump’s arguments for ""broad-based tariffs,"" which will promise a 10% across-the-board tariff on all foreign imports, disregarding economists’ concern about fueling inflation. he will also back up the former president in advocating for the border wall and opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants. trump’s selection of jd vance strikes up a stark contrast with his former vice president, mike pence, who tore into trump for being unfaithful to the u.s. constitution and for his prominent role in the january 6th attack. ""vance is an echo to trump,"" said david niven, the associate professor of politics at the university of cincinnati. ""he’s not a new voice."""

'cpr act': dc council wants schools to create cardiac emergency response plans,"on wednesday, the d.c. council held a hearing to require all d.c. public schools to have a plan in place when it comes to how to respond to a cardiac arrest.","July 10, 2024 8:30pm EDT","washington-on wednesday, the d.c. council held a hearing to require alld.c. public schoolsto have a plan in place when it comes to how to respond to a cardiac arrest. it's called the cpr act and was introduced by a majority of the council in november 2023. the legislation would require all d.c. public schools to establish cardiac emergency response plans — a protocol that ensures a school is ready to take lifesaving measures if or when a student, staff member or athlete goes into cardiac arrest. wednesday's hearing saw the american heart association and the nfl teaming up to explain why it's so crucial to have specific protocols to deal with cardiac arrest. ""what we know now is just having an aed or people trained in cpr might not be enough,"" said stuart berlow with the american heart association. ""we need to have a plan in place so when there is that emergency, people know what to do, people are prepared to jump into action and save a life."" according to the aha, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur every year in the united states and 23,000 of them occur among youth under age 18. and data shows that bystander cpr can double or triple survival rates. in fact, fems reports nearly 700 cardiac arrests in 2023, with only an 8.3% survival rate. but when prompt cpr was provided before fems arrival, survival rates increased to 44%, per aha statistics. what really brought this to the forefront wasthe case of damar hamlin, the buffalo bills player who suffered cardiac arrest last year during monday night football. people who were trained and nearby saved his life. that's what happened withdelya sommerville. the d.c. resident was on her normal run when she suffered sudden cardiac arrest right outside the u.s. capitol. thankfully, capitol police and congresswoman vicky hartzler conducted cpr, used an aed, and saved her life when her heart stopped beating. ""i'm just here to tell my story and i hope that every school in d.c. has the same level of preparedness that they had on that day,"" sommerville said. currently, d.c. schools do have aed in buildings, which has been a requirement since 2017, but not necessarily a clear response plan in place in case they have to use one. according to supporters of the cpr act, they also don't have aeds in all school sporting venues. ""we want to see them in gymnasiums, we want to see them at tournaments, tennis courts, basketball courts, football fields, softball fields. wherever students are playing and engaged in vigorous activity, that's where we need to have aeds, that's where people need to know cpr,"" said kenneth edmonds, vp of government affairs for the nfl. ten states, including maryland, already have laws or policies requiring cpr and aed response plans in schools. this was the first hearing for this bill and they're hoping to get it passed and in place by next school year. each school would be required to tailor the plan to their own needs and create a response team. dc public schools’ senior deputy chief of student support, dr. deitra bryant mallory, provided a statement to fox 5 wednesday, saying: ""the health and safety of our students, staff, and visitors are paramount; every dcps school has at least one functioning aed that is in ready status to be used in emergency situations."

""putin wants nothing less, nothing less, than ukraine’s total subjugation… and to wipe ukraine off the map,"" biden said in his opening speech at the nato summit. ""ukraine can and will stop putin."" the president vowed that the united states would prioritize ukraine when providing foreign assistance and exporting critical air defense interceptors. the strong and confident speech delivered by the president was widely dismissed due to it being scripted and read from a teleprompter. ""we don’t see how he can come back after the debate,"" said a european diplomat. ""i can’t imagine him being at the helm of the u.s. and nato for four more years."" both biden’s presidency is at stake and potentially the future of the transatlantic alliance that has aided in keeping peace in a large portion of the world for more than half a century. the former president has repeatedly dismissed the importance of nato while showing admiration for russian president vladimir putin. trump said he would allow russia to do ""whatever the hell they want"" with countries that don’t meet nato defense-funding requirements and that he would pressure ukraine into a peace deal with russia that would see kyiv cede territory in the process if he wins the presidency. president biden has made traditional alliances abroad the epicenter of his foreign policy after former president trump distanced and challenged allies through his ""america first"" approach. ""look, foreign leaders have seen joe biden up close and personal for the last three years,"" a senior administration official said. ""they know who they’re dealing with, and, you know, they know how effective he’s been."" the democratic party and voters across the nation are still itching with concern. texas senator john cornyn broke the silence among the republican party, warning of biden’s ""weakness"" before the nato summit.

""i hope president biden can summon up the energy, and the forcefulness, and the ability to express this important message to our friends and allies around the world because our adversaries are watching, but so are our friends."" biden will hold his first solo press conference since november this thursday evening."

"us gun violence crisis hits home for dc mother: 'when they took him, they took me'","the u.s. surgeon general issued a stark warning tuesday, identifying gun violence as a national health crisis — a reality that resonates deeply with many residents of the d.c. area.","June 25, 2024 5:35pm EDT","washington-theu.s. surgeon general issued a stark warning tuesday, identifying gun violence as a national health crisis — a reality that resonates deeply with many residents of the d.c. area. the advisory highlights that gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in the country, surpassing car accidents and drug overdoses. in a statement, surgeon general vivek murthy emphasized the severity of the situation, comparing it to the smoking epidemic of the 1960s. ""our children should not have to live in fear that they’re going to get shot when they go to school. none of us should have to worry that going to the mall or a concert or a house of worship means putting our lives at risk or that we'll get a call that a loved one, in a moment of crisis, is taking their own life with a firearm,"" murthy said. toloria gant, a d.c. resident, understands the personal toll of gun violence. her 23-year-old son brandon was shot and killed on september 6, 2023, at the corner of minnesota avenue and 18 street, southeast. the motive remains unknown, and the killer has not been caught. ""somebody's got to get control over what's going on in the city. it is in a crisis to me. it really is in a crisis,"" gant said. the surgeon general's advisory notes that gun death rates are 27 percent higher in poorer communities. cass crifasi, director of the center for gun violence solutions at johns hopkins university, highlighted the broader context of the issue. ""a crime perspective would think about bad people doing bad things. a public health perspective says there are people in a set of circumstances—communities, societal circumstances, policy choices—that we have made that individuals don’t often have control over but are operating in,"" crifasi explained. ""factors like education, poverty, unemployment, poor quality housing all drive fire and violence, so it’s important to be thinking about this as a public health perspective because it broadens our potential solutions."" for gant, the emotional and psychological impacts of losing her son are profound. ""i suffer from so many anxieties, ptsd and things like that, 'cause this is all i have left of him. this is all i've got. so when they took him, they took me. they just need to know that,"" she said. local officials are also speaking out about the surgeon general's warning. prince george's county executive angela alsobrooks, who is running for the u.s. senate, emphasized the need for more effective gun control as part of any comprehensive solution. ""the level of gun violence we experience on a daily basis is a uniquely american tragedy; and what we know is that gun violence is absolutely a public health crisis,"" alsobrooks said in a statement. instead of leaders standing up to the gun lobby and banning assault weapons or getting ghost guns off the street, they have asked children to shoulder this burden by learning how to hide under a desk in a classroom.""the fact that our kids are now expected to endure this crisis by learning to cope with the trauma sparked by even witnessing senseless acts of gun violence is wholly unacceptable. in the senate, i will be a fierce advocate for sensible gun legislation that bans assault weapons, that eliminates ghost guns, and institutes stronger background checks. our children deserve nothing less."" the surgeon general's advisory calls for urgent action to address gun violence as a public health emergency, underscoring the need for immediate and comprehensive measures to protect communities across the nation."

""i was definitely worried, scared,"" she said, describing how she would scour his car for drugs and drug paraphernalia to ensure their daughters would not drive the vehicle around with the substances. biden's ex-girlfriend, zoe kestan, also took the stand, walking the jury through biden’s rampant drug abuse throughout their relationship, including him smoking crack in hotel rooms, stealing away to public bathrooms to smoke crack and how she helped pick up drugs for him. she said the crack cocaine he purchased often was the size of a ""ping pong ball,"" which he broke into pieces and lit up in glass pipes. kestan testified under immunity. the jury took roughly three hours across two days to reach the guilty verdict. biden will be sentenced later this year, though no date has yet been issued. the law license suspension in washington, d.c., comes after biden's defense team re-submitted a motion requesting a new criminal trial, arguing the federal court in delaware lacked jurisdiction to go to trial earlier this month. the motion comes one week after lowell filed a similar motion but quickly withdrew it without explanation. read the full dc court of appeals order below:"

""we’re excited to welcome president trump back,"" said house speakermike johnsona day earlier. the republican speaker had demurred over whether he’s asked trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another jan. 6. ""of course he respects that, we all do, and we’ve all talked about it, ad nauseum."" trump told johnson thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a ""terrific job,"" according to a republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. trump asked rep. marjorie taylor greene, the speaker’s chief republican critic, if she was being nice to johnson, another republican said. trump is expected to be delivering remarks and discussing issues animating his campaign — including massimmigration deportationsbut also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. many potential priorities for a new white house administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, includingproject 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though trump has made clear he has his own agenda. but the private meetings with house and later in the afternoon senate republicans so close to the capitol are infused with symbolism of trump’s return as the u.s. president who threatened the american tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power. ""it’s frustrating,"" said former u.s. capitol police officerharry dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for congress as a maryland democrat in the aftermath of jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn president joe biden’s election. dunn spoke of the ""irony"" of trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him.

""during and after wwii, we were all together. and there was a great feeling of patriotism because we had won the war, and we had conquered the people that were just miserable. and the country was together,"" said cohn, ""unfortunately, our country is not together right now, and i think we have to work on it to get it back together. that’s what the lesson should be about wwii. we set the example. now follow and get together. and you don’t have to be of the same party, but you can be civil and reach, you can reach a hand across and shake the hand of your opponent and there’s nothing wrong with that."" hundreds of thousands of visitors mark memorial day at the wwii memorial each year. officials asked fox 5 to remind visitors they can sit down and wet their feet at the memorial fountain, but swimming, splashing, and wading through the water is not allowed. it could end in a ticket and is highly disrespectful to those being honored with the memorial."

"dc crimes act passes house, threatening local sentencing reforms","the u.s. house of representatives passed the d.c. crimes act (hr 7530) on wednesday afternoon, a move that would limit d.c.'s ability to modify its sentencing laws.","May 15, 2024 7:24pm EDT","washington-the u.s. house of representatives passed thed.c. crimes act (hr 7530)on wednesday afternoon, a move that would limit d.c.'s ability to modify its sentencing laws. the legislation aims to restrict the d.c. council's authority and significantly curtail the youth rehabilitation act, which allows judges to impose age-appropriate sentences on individuals aged 18 to 24 and potentially seal their records upon sentence completion to aid in reintegration. liz komar with the sentencing reform counsel with the sentencing project, criticized the bill. ""the d.c. crimes act is a profound attack on home rule and public safety that would prevent dc lawmakers from increasing or decreasing any criminal penalties,"" she said. komar highlighted that the d.c. council had recently passed the secure d.c. omnibus amendment act in early march after extensive debates and community feedback. despite criticisms of its severity, komar believes the council's action demonstrated a willingness to addressconstituents' concerns about crime. according to komar, the d.c. crimes act would have blocked this local legislative effort entirely. komar also argued that the bill's rollbacks to the youth rehabilitation act, which has been shown to reduce repeat offenses, would not enhance public safety. ""limiting the yra will not strengthen communities; instead, it will deepen racial disparities and increase incarceration. we urge senate leadership to ensure that this bill does not advance any further,"" she added. house committee on oversight and accountability chairman james comer (r-ky.) praised the bipartisan passage of h.r. 7530. ""the d.c. crimes act will help rein in crime and lawlessness in washington to restore law and order in our nation’s capital city. all americans deserve to feel safe in their nation’s capital, and today’s passage of rep. byron donalds’ bill is a step in the right direction,"" comer said. the house committee on oversight and accountability views this action as part of its constitutional duty to oversee the governance of the district of columbia. the d.c. crimes act still has to pass the senate and be signed by president joe biden to become official. earlier this week, the white house released a statement of administration policy saying, ""the [biden] administration strongly opposes h.r. 7530, the d.c. criminal reforms to immediately make everyone safe (d.c. crimes) act of 2024, which would prevent the district of columbia from increasing criminal penalties. earlier this year, the district enacted the secure d.c. act, with the mayor’s strong support and no opposition in the d.c. council, which gave police and prosecutors new tools – including increased penalties – to address gun violence and carjackings. had the d.c. crimes act of 2024 been enacted at the time, it would have blocked the district’s increases to criminal penalties. the d.c. crimes act of 2024 is a counterproductive and destructive invasion of the district’s right to self-governance and would impede public safety and crime reduction. this bill highlights why the district of columbia should have statehood."""

george washington university president calls ongoing encampment 'illegal',the president of george washington university called the ongoing protest encampment on campus unlawful and warned of the potential danger it is growing into.,"May 6, 2024 1:00pm EDT","washington-the president of george washington university called the ongoing protest encampment on campus unlawful and warned of the potential danger it is growing into. president ellen granberg released a statement sunday, nearly two weeks after the demonstrations over the israel-hamas war began on school grounds. ""there is a dire humanitarian crisis occurring in gaza that must be addressed, and i am personally grief-stricken by the suffering and loss of innocent lives occurring on both sides of this conflict. i fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues—as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the district's laws,"" granberg’s statement said.

""so far, all of these efforts have failed to end the encampment or deter the protesters from escalating the situation."" read more:gwu protest organizers vow to stay on campus until demands are met she said the university is not equipped to handle the situation and must ""rely on the support and experience of the dc metropolitan police department."" the demonstrations began on april 25. since around the same time, colleges and universities around the country that have seen dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests at demonstrations over the ongoing israel-hamas war. dear members of the george washington university community, it has been over a week since a group of students established an unauthorized protest encampment on gw's university yard. since then, there have been many conversations about students' rights to free expression and assembly and whether this is a peaceful protest. in this message, i want to directly address those conversations, share what we are experiencing on campus, and outline our desired outcomes moving forward. before i begin, i want to make clear that i believe the issues at the heart of this protest are important and deserve our full attention and consideration. there is a dire humanitarian crisis occurring in gaza that must be addressed, and i am personally grief-stricken by the suffering and loss of innocent lives occurring on both sides of this conflict. i fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues—as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the district's laws. however, what is currently happening at gw is not a peaceful protest protected by the first amendment or our university’s policies. the demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of gw property. history has repeatedly shown that there are many effective ways for communities to express their differing viewpoints lawfully within the district of columbia. in the last seven months alone, at gw, we have seen this play out on all sides of the war between israel and hamas. i know that some in our community and others across the country argue that this, too, is simply a peaceful protest – and, at certain times, this has been true. however, when protesters overrun barriers established to protect the community, vandalize a university statue and flag, surround and intimidate gw students with antisemitic images and hateful rhetoric, chase people out of a public yard based on their perceived beliefs, and ignore, degrade, and push gw police officers and university maintenance staff, the protest ceases to be peaceful or productive. all of these things have happened at gw in the last five days. it is also essential to highlight that at no point was this encampment lawful. from the moment gw students declared their intent to establish an encampment on university yard, they were in direct violation of multiple university policies and were trespassing on a space explicitly reserved for the gw law final examinations. the university, which is committed to protecting our students' rights to free expression, informed them of this and quickly offered a secure alternative protest site where gw would support them in holding peaceful daytime demonstrations. this offer was repeatedly refused. finally, it is clear that this is no longer a gw student demonstration. it has been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community's best interest in mind. it is increasingly unsafe and a violation of university and city regulations to have so many unidentified and unvetted people from outside the gw community living on university property. conventional protests that abide by municipal law and university policy should and do receive protection and respect, no matter the message's viewpoint. as i have outlined, this is not what is happening at gw. for these reasons, the george washington university continues to tirelessly pursue every avenue available to resolve the situation swiftly and safely. we have offered an alternative demonstration site, requested the assistance of the dc metropolitan police department, erected barriers to contain the protest, initiated academic and administrative consequences for trespassing gw students, expanded our security resources and personnel, and conducted regular and sustained dialogues with gw students connected to the camp. so far, all of these efforts have failed to end the encampment or deter the protesters from escalating the situation. as a university, we are not equipped to single-handedly manage an unprecedented situation such as this. the gw police force is, and should only be, prepared to protect our community during normal university operations and to respond to routine and urgent incidents. when unlawful activities go beyond these limits, we must rely on the support and experience of the dc metropolitan police department. at this time, the district is in communication with the university, and the dc metropolitan police are providing an increased security presence on and around university yard. i understand and fully share the deep concern many feel about the status of the protest. many are frustrated that it is continuing; some are willing for it to proceed indefinitely. at gw, our commitment remains to regain and maintain the safety and security of university yard, pursue accountability for those who have destroyed university property and harassed our community, and return our university to normal operations. this includes, of course, allowing and promoting the free exercise of various viewpoints and means of expression by members of our community within the limits of university policies. we continue to ask for the full support of our partners, including the district of columbia, in pursuing these aims. sincerely, ellen m. granberg president the associated press contributed to this report."

student protestsover the israel-hamas war have popped up on an increasing number of u.s. college campuses following last week’s arrest of more than 100 demonstrators at columbia university. the associated press contributed to this report. dear members of the george washington university community, we are writing today to provide an update on the university’s response thus far to the protest encampment on university yard and to outline our expectations for the days to come. gw remains dedicated to protecting our community’s rights to activism, engagement, and the free expression of diverse viewpoints. this vigor and breadth of dialogue about important issues is a hallmark of the gw experience and essential to our university’s ability to foster social and intellectual growth. free expression and activism, however, are not unlimited. our highest priority is, and always will be, maintaining a safe campus environment that allows for the world-class academic experience our students and their families have entrusted us with providing. the encampment on university yard violates our clearly defined rules of conduct and behavior. further, the actions of some protestors have been highly offensive to many members of our community. the protest is jeopardizing our ability to meet the priorities of our university community, and the hateful language being displayed has no place on our campus. from the start, gw provided a secure alternate location to hold a peaceful demonstration to ensure the continuation of university business. demonstrators were instructed to move to anniversary park, which they could use daily until 7:00 p.m. on thursday, when the demonstrators refused multiple times to relocate, gwpd requested the assistance of the dc metropolitan police department to provide additional support related to the demonstration. as far as the university is aware, there have been no incidents of violence. however, as the first evening progressed and the crowd on university yard grew larger, our priority became safeguarding our community and implementing the safest resolution possible with the personnel and resources gw had available. with this in mind, the university focused on limiting access to university yard as protestors departed, without resorting to forcible relocation, and on initiating academic and administrative consequences for those who continued trespassing on gw property. the determination was made that students who remained in the encampment would be placed on temporary suspension and administratively barred from campus. it is important to note that, due to federal regulations, the university will not comment on individual student conduct cases or ongoing conduct cases, including confirming whether or not such a case exists. gw continues to offer anniversary park as an alternate demonstration site and implores demonstrators to vacate university yard immediately. in the meantime, we have reduced the space available for the 20 remaining demonstrators to minimize further disruption to university activities. we are also allowing access to food and water. we have provided demonstrators with clear information on how to access medical assistance if needed. on friday evening, april 26, demonstrators barred from university yard established a second encampment in the middle of h street, beyond the barriers securing gw property. currently, we are aware of approximately 20 tents erected in the street by individuals from across the region. this demonstration is on public property and under the jurisdiction of the dc government. the city street is neither controlled nor maintained by the george washington university. mpd is monitoring this first amendment demonstration in coordination with gwpd to ensure the safety and security of the community. this is an evolving situation tied to a larger coordinated national protest effort that we will continue to monitor and address. as we approach the end of the academic year, our ability to operate in a way that ensures the academic success and personal well-being of our community becomes even more critical. we are committed to ensuring that important moments in our students’ educational journeys, including finals and commencement, may happen safely and appropriately. but fulfilling this commitment takes everyone. we ask that the entire gw community join us in creating the campus environment that we all came to gw to experience: a community that supports those who want to voice their perspectives on important issues and encourages

""we hear them and understand that, and while the first and most pressing responsibility we have is that they are safe and that we’re encouraged by the progress, but know there’s still a lot more to do. the feeling of safety is important as well, and as a baseline, you do have to bring crime down, and that’s why we’re so focused on that,"" appiah said, stressing the importance of police-community relations. the decreases thus far this year are evident in month-over-month data. d.c. council passed the prioritizing public safety emergency act of 2023 in july of 2023. the bill did many things, and appiah says the improvements are a collective effort by the d.c. government, but she specifically pointed to pre-trial detention for those accused of serious crimes as being significant. that was codified in the recently passed secure d.c. legislation fox 5 looked at homicides, assault with a dangerous weapon, carjackings, and auto thefts month over month starting in january 2023. spikes into last summer are evident in the data, but july appeared to mark the beginning of downward trend lines for these crimes, and they’re trends that have continued to decline. denise krepp remains leery of another summer spike and said she won’t believe the trends we’re seeing are legitimate until the end of this calendar year. appiah says the public safety apparatus is working now to mitigate a summer surge with the hopes of keeping the current trend lines in the right direction."

""the cool weather is actually going to keep the blossoms on the trees a little bit longer than they might normally."" litterst said the next phase after peak bloom is when we go from blossoms to leaves. warm temperatures tend to speed up that process.

""we’re grappling with what a lot of other areas around the country are dealing with, especially in this region, where if that use is not viable, work with the landowner and come up with a viable use for it. in a lot of cases, i think that’s going to be residential and there might be benefits for that but there might be other uses that make sense,"" wilson said. mayor wilson adds it’s an efficient, environmentally friendlier way to increase inventory, build a tax base, bring life to an area, and deal with the decreasing demand for office space that isn’t located near public transit. wilson also noted people’s transit habits have changed in a world of hybrid work, and these types of conversions are helpful economic drivers. the developer says cityhouse old town should finish its conversion in summer 2025."

""i told her, my grandfather told her before he passed on, keep him away from relisha. he was getting too fond of relisha,"" said wheeler about his warnings to relisha’s mother. but it took 18 days before anyone realized the little girl was missing. ""they're asking me when the last time i seen her. i was told she was at ashley’s house. shomika, her mother, told them she was at the shelter last. no she wasn’t,"" wheeler said. during the weeks-long search for relisha, tatum shot and killed himself, and it’s widely believed by investigators that he killed her before taking his life. but there are others with different theories and many are still searching for her to this day.

""what keeps me up in the past was just her screaming for daddy or screaming for help, period and nobody was there. nobody was there,"" wheeler said. but since relisha’s body has never been found, there’s hope she’s still alive and one woman who is the longest living jane doe says we can’t give up just yet. ""being missing for 50 years that was the assumption, but all missing children aren’t dead,"" said monique smith. ""we’re alive, we’re walking, we don’t know that we were abducted, and this is the same hope i have for relisha."" ""i got my hopes. i honestly do,"" added wheeler. ""i spoke with my son, and he says he believes she’s still alive, they’re just not looking hard enough. i got hope, but i’m preparing for the worst."" if you know anything about the case, you’re asked to contact d.c. police's youth and family services division. you can also send tips to the black and missing foundation, who will pass along that information to law enforcement."

"new bill would allow dc to boot, tow cars repeatedly caught speeding; drivers could be sued over fines","d.c. leaders want drivers to slow down, and they’ve adopted new legislation to punish those who don’t.","February 7, 2024 12:11pm EST","washington-d.c. leaders want drivers to slow down, and they’ve adopted new legislation to punish those who don’t. thed.c. councilunanimously approved a bill to strengthen the consequences for dangerous drivers andthose who fail to pay fines for traffic violations tuesday. those drivers will now face harsher penalties and could even be subject to civil lawsuits from the district’s attorney general. thestrengthening traffic enforcement, education, and responsibility act of 2024 (""steer act"")was introduced by councilmember charles allen. it would add teeth to the district’s automated traffic enforcement (ate) camera program and close loopholes after someone is arrested for drunk driving. the bill passed after a year with 52 traffic deaths, an increase from 35, with hundreds more experiencing major injuries from a crash. allen says last year, district ate cameras issued more than 57,000 tickets for vehicles traveling 20-30 mph over the speed limit, more than 180,000 tickets for vehicles going 15-20 mph over and more than one million tickets for cars going 11-15 mph over. ""dangerous driving is far too common in everydc neighborhood. it’s obvious right now that a significant number of drivers do not fear accountability for speeding, driving recklessly, or driving drunk. and why should they? nothing about their experience tells them there are consequences,"" said allen, who chairs the council’s committee on transportation and the environment. ""that’s about to change now that the council has spoken clearly. after extensive public testimony and oversight, the bill approved today will create real, commonsense accountability measures to reduce speeding and reckless behavior in our neighborhoods and close loopholes blocking accountability,"" he continued in a statement. under the newly passed bill, d.c. would have the authority to boot and tow vehicles repeatedly caught speeding by cameras. the bill would also establish a point system for drivers who speed and if a vehicle accumulates 10 points in a six-month window, it immediately becomes eligible for booting and towing. the system gives drivers two points for speeding 11-15 mph over the limit, three points for 16-19 mph over and five points for 20+ mph over the limit. reckless driving is five points and aggravated reckless driving is 10 points. under the bill, a new intelligent speed assistance program would allow for ""speed governors"" — devices that can prevent drivers from exceeding a certain speed — to be installed for drivers whose license was suspended or revoked because of excessive speeding or reckless driving. the steer act also grants new authority for the district’s attorney general to go after dangerous drivers, whether in d.c. or out-of-state, in civil court if they have a large balance of unpaid moving violations. ""we must redouble our efforts to crack down on dangerous drivers who put pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers at risk,"" dc attorney general brian schwalb said. ""the steer act would provide the office of the attorney general with critical new authority to hold drivers who flout the law accountable, and i applaud councilmember allen for advancing this bill, which would be a major step toward improving traffic safety across the district."" mayor muriel bowserand congress would still need to sign off on the legislation before it becomes law."

""we know that driving down crime requires us to send a clear message that if you make our city less safe, if you bring violence to our community, you will be held accountable,"" mayor muriel bowser said in a statement earlier this month. ""i look forward to signing this bill into law and urge the council to move with urgency to unanimously pass this legislation."" ward 2 councilmember brooke pinto introduced the bill, which is a collection of laws that, among other things, would better hold offenders accountable by eliminating or extending the length of statutes of limitations for certain serious crimes, making misdemeanor arrest warrants extraditable and even expanding the definition of carjacking to make sure they can be properly prosecuted. ""in 2023 we saw a devastating 39% increase in violent crime, a 26% increase in crime overall in the district, 274 people lost their lives to homicide,"" pinto said during tuesday’s council meeting. ""residents are in fear of carjacking, thefts and falling victim to crime across our city. this is unacceptable today. by approving my secure dc omnibus, the council has the opportunity to take decisive and comprehensive action to make the district safer and more secure."" the bill would also toughen the city's gun laws, make directing retail theft a punishable crime, allow police to chase criminals who pose an imminent danger to the public and introduce new intervention programs for inmates to help lower recidivism rates. additionally, the act would increase protections for senior citizens, children and victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence. ""we’ve all been guided by a desire to keep our city safe and hopefully the public will see that we’ve put in a lot of effort to try to make sure that they understand that we are working our tails off to try to improve conditions because what we’re experiencing right now is absolutely unacceptable,"" d.c. councilmember kenyan mcduffie said. one of the concerns some have brought to the table, however, is that the legislation could unfairly target black and brown residents in the district. some provisions of the legislation were removed to address those concerns, such as making mask-wearing illegal and allowing police to take dna samples from people upon arrest. pinto says she’s taken input from people in every ward and spoken to the 12 other councilmembers but despite this, some people still are not happy with some parts of the bill. ""so many of these provisions in this bill do not address the root cause of the harm that’s happening in our city and yes, we all agree that something needs to be done but it wasn’t this and i’m glad the council saw through this. they can go back to the drawing board, they can get some more amendments in there to really address the harm that’s happening in our communities,"" community organizer frankie seabron said. this was the first reading of the bill and another is expected in a few weeks. that will be followed by a second vote."

secure dc crime bill: what’s in the secure dc omnibus amendment act of 2024?,the d.c. council will hold the first of two votes tuesday on the city's newest crime bill. the secure dc omnibus amendment act of 2024 was introduced by public safety committee chair councilmember brook pinto last year. the bill is a collection of different laws proposed to address what mayor muriel bowser has repeatedly referred to as gaps in the system.,"February 6, 2024 12:24pm EST","washington-the d.c. council will hold the first of two votes tuesday on the city's newest crime bill. the secure dc omnibus amendment act of 2024 was introduced by public safety committee chair councilmember brook pinto last year. the bill is a collection of different laws proposed to address what mayor muriel bowser has repeatedly referred to as gaps in the system. the bill would eliminate or extend the length of statutes of limitations for certain serious crimes, according to the council’s website. it would make misdemeanor arrest warrants extraditable, and also clarify that gps records in the possession of the pretrial services agency can be admissible to prove a defendant’s guilt in a criminal case or other judicial proceeding. it would also enhance protections for seniors and children and also increase protections for victims of sexual and domestic violence. read more:trump calls for federal government to 'take over dc' in the wake of mike gill's murder ensure accountability for offenders: - eliminate or extend the length of statutes of limitations for certain serious crimes, such as attempts to commit murder or sexual abuse, along with crimes that are committed in the same incident as one of those crimes. these changes would help to improve accountability, particularly in cases where a victim comes forward years after the crime was committed (as often happens in sexual assault cases). - make misdemeanor arrest warrants extraditable outside the district where a court finds good cause. this is particularly important given how the district’s small size and proximity to maryland and virginia. - clarify that gps records in the possession of the pretrial services agency (psa) can be admissible to prove a defendant’s guilt in a criminal case or other judicial proceeding. current law is unclear on this issue, and while the usao consistently maintains that the law allows these records to be admitted as evidence of guilt, some defendants have attempted to construe the statutes to the contrary. this is a common-sense measure that would make clear that gps records from psa that, for example, indicate that a defendant was on the scene of a domestic violence incident or a homicide, can be admissible in that defendant’s trial for domestic violence or murder. read more:3 injured in northeast dc shooting, helicopter searches for suspects enhance protections for senior citizens: - add ""assault with significant bodily injury"" to a list of offenses that qualify for sentencing enhancements  when committed  against  senior citizens. this would rectify an apparent oversight in existing law and ensure that seniors receive the protections they deserve. protect victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence: - prohibit individuals who have been convicted of stalking from  possessing a  firearm. according to everytown for gun safety, in nearly 9 out of 10 cases of attempted murders of women, there had been at least one stalking incident in the year prior to the attempted murder. - create a standalone felony offense of strangulation. strangulation is a key predictor of future domestic violence turning deadly; creating a standalone offense would make it easier to  hold individuals  who engage  in  this conduct  accountable and prevent the  worst outcomes. this change would also bring the district in line with the 49 other states that allow strangulation to be prosecuted as a felony. - allow for testing of defendants charged with sexual assault for hiv in order to provide victims with information about their attacker’s hiv status more quickly. this would allow victims to make informed decisions about their health care. in cases where the defendant is hiv-negative, it would allow victims to avoid weeks of post-exposure medication, which can cause severe side effects. testing of this kind currently may only occur after conviction, which will always be too late to allow victims to make informed decisions about their health care. - create new evidentiary rules to give courts discretion to admit evidence of previous similar crimes in sexual abuse and child sexual abuse cases. similar evidentiary rules in california helped bring harvey weinstein to justice following decades of sexual abuse allegations. - establish progressive  sentencing  for serial  misdemeanor  sex offenders. right  now, individuals who repeatedly engage in misdemeanor sexual abuse are generally only subject to a maximum of 180 days’ imprisonment, no matter how many times they re-offend. this change would increase the maximum sentence to 3 years for individuals with one or more prior convictions for misdemeanor sexual abuse within the past 10 years. it would also allow these individuals to be detained pretrial, offering greater security and peace to victims and community members. - close a loophole in the prohibition on non-consensual dissemination of sexual images. as it stands, the law requires prosecutors to prove that there was an ""agreement or understanding"" that the sexual image would not be disclosed. because it is difficult to prove that such an agreement existed, this language has hampered prosecution of these cases. this proposal would put the focus instead on the defendant’s mental state and the lack of consent in the distribution of the image. read more:'targeted and violated': vicious robbery leaves victim crawling in dc improve protections for children: - direct courts to expedite cases involving a child victim. currently, the law only expedites cases where a child is called to give testimony; this would expand that to cases where a child is a victim, even where the child doesn’t testify. it would also allow courts to expedite sentencing hearings. these changes would help to minimize the length of time child victims are exposed to the criminal justice process. - create enhanced penalties for domestic violence crimes committed in the presence of a child. this change recognizes the well-documented and significant harm that witnessing violence has on children. - create additional protections for 12-year-old victims of sexual abuse. under current law, individuals found guilty of a sex offense are subject to increased penalties if the victim is under 12 years old. this change recognizes the youthful nature of 12-year-olds and extends those protections to them. the change would also improve consistency with other statutes that draw a line between 12- and 13-year-olds. - extend liability for certain sexual offenses to contractors of organizations. currently, the law applies to both employees and volunteers, but not contractors; there is no obvious reason to exclude contractors from liability. ""we know that driving down crime requires us to send a clear message that if you make our city less safe, if you bring violence to our community, you will be held accountable. i appreciate councilmember pinto’s leadership and partnership on this legislation that includes most of our safer, stronger 2.0 legislation and our act now legislation,"" said bowser in a statement earlier this year. ""passing it will support a system that prioritizes safety and accountability. in 2023, we saw pieces of this legislation move our city in the right direction. now we can make those provisions permanent and focus on strategies and policies that will continue to make our city safer. i look forward to signing this bill into law and urge the council to move with urgency to unanimously pass this legislation."""

snow in dc could make a february return. here’s what we could be expecting,"after a quiet start, the long range forecast suggests more cold, and with it perhaps some better shots of accumulating snow as we approach the middle of february!","January 31, 2024 1:06pm EST","washington-by the standard set over recent years, this winter has already not been so bad snowfall wise. washington, d.c. has actually already picked up more snow this winter than we have totaled in five of the past seven winters. many came into this winter with much higher expectations, however, especially since manywinter outlooks, including our own, highlighted the increased risks for a blizzard this winter. is that risk still on the table? or has this winter given us all it has to offer already, with spring getting closer by the day? february is often a key month for seasonal snow forecasting. why? historically, it is the snowiest month of the year. despite also being the shortest month of the year, the d.c. region averages 5.0"" of snow throughout the month. some of the region's largest snow events have been hit during the month as well, such as the 2003 presidents’ day blizzard and snowmageddon back in 2010. the month has featured some monster snows, most common in el niño years. in fact, february during an el niño winter averages nearly two more inches compared to an average february. a moderate to strong el niño, which we are currently in the midst of, averages nearly double the typical snowfall. for fun though, i did also look at the el niño cases that did not produce much snow (less than 10"") through the start of february, and these winters did average less than normal snow throughout the month of february. if we get a little deeper into the averages though, we do find that there are extreme years that drive those averages up a little bit, like nearly 29"" of snow in february 2003 and 32"" of snow in february 2010. such extremes will have an impact on how an ""average"" looks. read more:dmv winter 2023-2024 outlook: why we're expecting more snow, chance for blizzards in dc this winter read more:winter weather in dc, maryland & virginia: how much snow have we seen? so really diving into the numbers, of the twenty-six el niño februarys on the record, only six have failed to put down any measurable snow at all (trace or less) during the month of february. that is not to say that most el niño februarys end up with a big snow though. in fact, only a little over 30% of el niño februarys end up with a major snow exceeding at least 6"" in washington, d.c. not a lot, but compared to the average february, a one-in-three shot is an above normal shot as far as winters go around here. the data shows that the majority of years, about 62% of them, end up with between 3-6"" of snow. coincidentally, we need just about half a foot more of snow to verify an ""above normal snowfall"" season here. one thing that is undeniable is that, despite only a handful of it falling as measurable snow, it has been one of the stormiest winters on record here in the d.c. region. in just the last two months, we have completely erased the drought that plagued our region since the summer of 2023. we received just as much rain in december and january as we picked up in the entirety of the summer months, which is quite a rare feat. in fact, this was only the third time in recorded d.c. weather history that the city picked up over a foot of rain since december 1st. january alone featured nearly half a foot of rain, which is a feat we have not done in forty-five years. it has been an incredibly wet winter. while an active storm track is typically a great thing for snow, it is not a guarantee that a big blizzard awaits in february. in fact, of all the years when at least 10"" of rain fell in december and january, only one case featured a big blizzard in the month of february. that was back in february 1979, when a storm around presidents' day dropped widespread 20"" snowfall amounts around the dc region. coincidentally, 1979 was also the last year that saw half a foot of rain in just january alone, so there is some connection there! despite the stormy winter, all indications are that february is going to start off on a relatively quiet note. unlike the middle of january where we had a strong connection to arctic cold, at the moment we do not have any strong atmospheric mechanisms to pull stronger cold out of canada and pull it eastward. while we will occasionally get brief pushes of winter cold, the first two weeks of the new month really do not offer too much in the way of excitement in terms of cold, snow, or even rain for that matter. there was one storm that we are keeping an eye on into early next week, in the sunday to tuesday timeframe. over this past weekend, there were several computer guidance indications that this storm could take a turn north up the east coast and provide another decent shot at some snowfall for much of the region. more recent indications have been for this storm to pass well to the south of the mid-atlantic though. we will, of course, let you know if there are last-minute shifts on this track, but at the moment we favor this one to miss our region entirely, leaving us dry into the first full week of february. while the pattern does start quiet at the beginning of the month, the vast majority of longer-range guidance suggests we will be in for at least one more round of sustained winter cold, and with it perhaps some better shots of accumulating snow as we approach the middle of the month. various models have suggested that blocking patterns will redevelop over the arctic regions after about the 10th of the month. similar in nature to what we experienced in the middle of january, these blocks should help provide stronger and more prolonged surges of cold air into the eastern united states. at the same time, most show the active storm track returning to the pattern. at the same time, a climate feature known as the madden-julian oscillation (mjo for short) will be swinging into what is known as the colder phases. you can read about the details of this signal in our winter weather outlook but know that when is in the aptly named colder phases that stronger cold air transport from canada into the united states is much more common. from a snow lovers’ perspective, it is an exciting pattern to see on paper. computer models have had their struggles this winter though. so, until we actually see the guidance roll over from the longer range, into the shorter range, we will be a little skeptical. however, when we look at statistics and history, february is the most commonly colder than normal month during an el niño year. i personally do not think that we will add any snow in the first ten days of the month at least, however, but i also do not believe we have seen our final snow of the season yet either. we will look for the pattern to get more exciting towards the middle of the month. stay tuned..."

""sierra, you know there’s lots of misinformation that happens out there,"" he said. ""i’ve helped lead council, over half a billion dollars for mpd funding, helped grow our cadet program, helped increase penalties … criminal penalties for gun crimes so we know that we gotta have a smart and balanced approach and hold accountable people who commit violence in our city and also work to solve the big problems."""

""mindful drinking fest actually started in 2022 and it was because a lot of people were trying non-alcoholic products but it's a little confusing. what's out there, right?"" brown said. the event is reflective of a notable shift in attitudes toward drinking — particularly among millennials and gen z — in recent years. anaugust 2023 gallup pollfound that 62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, which is down from 72% two decades ago. the same study shows that among young adults 18 to 35 years old, fewer than four in 10 (38%) report that they are regular drinkers, meaning they’ve had a drink within the past seven days. there are several reasons for this change. one is diversification. the percentage of young adults who are black, hispanic, asian or another racial minority has nearly doubled over the past two decades andstudies showthat these groups are less likely to drink than white americans. another is marijuana use, whichhas doubledamong adults in the past 10 years. but the most highly cited reason among young adults for drinking less is simply for their well-being. ""the most important reason that people report is health. we've seen a lot of information about the way alcohol affects us,"" brown, who is also a certified wellness coach, told fox 5. ""and they're deciding they're either going to keep drinking and maybe incorporate non-alcoholic beverages and low alcohol beverages."" another2023 gallup pollnoted that a record-high 39% of americans said that consuming one or two drinks per day is bad for one’s health, with a sharp 18-point increase noted among 18 to 34-year-olds. the change in perception followed indications from theworld health organizationthat no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health and updated guidelines from thecenters for disease control and preventionon alcohol intake. mindful drinking fest, and mindful drinking in general, isn’t about preaching abstinence, brown says. ""it's about you setting the goals for yourself, and making sure that the way you drink supports your lifestyle and the way that you would like to live,"" he said. the practice encourages building positive habits and drinking in relationship to your personal goals — health or otherwise. ""the short way to describe that is drinking with intention. so, you know, for whatever reason, sometimes because of peer pressure, sometimes because of conformity, sometimes because of just habit, we end up drinking more than we intend to,"" brown says. ""this is a way to change that habit, maybe to offer some alternatives and have the opportunity to go out spend time with friends, spend time at restaurants and bars, go to festivals — like mindful drinking fest — and have a delicious drink, an adult, sophisticated drink without really compromising or having to, like, stay home and sip soda water in the corner,"" he continued. the advent of the mindful drinking movement, also termed ""sober curious"" in earlier years, has led to a boom in the production of no- and low-alcohol adult beverages that are focused on delivering flavorful, indulgent and innovative options. according to amarket analysis, the non-alcoholic category surpassed $11 billion in sales in 2022 and is expected togrow by 25%through 2026. zero-proof bars have also been opening up the country as a way to provide the fun, ambiance and social aspects that many people are looking for, without the booze and, critically, without the punitive judgment that can often be associated with sobriety. ""this is about social wellness,""  brown says. ""it's not about what you're not drinking. it's not about not drinking alcohol. we're not saying that at all. this is another option and we want that option to be available for people. and [mindful drinking fest] is the celebration of that."" d.c.’s mindful drinking fest runs from friday, jan. 26 through sunday, jan. 28. tickets are $149, which includes all events for the weekend, and there is also an option for $40 tickets toonlyattend the disco mary rave at ivy city on saturday. brown says it’s important to remember that this isn’t about not drinking. ""the majority of people who come there are what we call substitutes — that means they switch out between non-alcoholic and alcohol products,"" he said. ""we understand that, so this is a festival for everyone."""

""let’s be encouraged, let’s press on and hope that we can join together and make this great difference,"" house speaker mike johnson, r-la., told the crowd. ""we can stand with every woman for every child, and we can truly build a culture that cherishes and protects life."" friday’s march for life is the second such event since the june 2022 supreme court ruling that ended the federal protection for abortion rights enshrined in roe v. wade. last year’s march was triumphant, with organizers relishing a state-by-state fight in legislatures around the country. speakers told the fired-up crowd that their fight is far from over and must continue until abortion becomes ""unthinkable."" appearing via video, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky and other members of congress thanked the crowd for their advocacy and urged them to keep pushing for anti-abortion policies. ""roe is done, but we still live in a culture that knows not how to care for life,"" said benjamin watson, a former nfl player who is now an anti-abortion advocate. ""roe is done, but the factors that drive women to seek abortions are ever apparent and ever increasing. roe is done, but abortion is still legal and thriving in too much of america."" bishop michael burbidge, chair of the committee for pro-life activities for the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, said the the dobbs decision that overturned roe v. wade was ""a victory but not a decisive one.""

""i almost didn’t come when i saw the forecast, but this is just incredible,"" said stephanie simpson, a 42-year-old grocery store employee from cleveland, who has attended the last four marches. the anti-abortion fight rages on, with mixed results. the ruling in dobbs v. jackson women’s health organization reverted abortion lawmaking back to the states, and 14 states are now enforcing bans on abortion throughout pregnancy. two more have such bans on hold because of court rulings. and another two have bans that take effect when cardiac activity can be detected, about six weeks into pregnancy — often before women know they’re pregnant. but abortion restrictions have also lost at the ballot box in ohio, kansas and kentucky. and total bans have produced high-profile causes for abortion rights supporters to rally around. kate cox, a texas mother of two, sought an abortion after learning the baby she was carrying had a fatal genetic condition. her request for an exemption from texas’ ban, one of the country’s strictest, was denied by the state supreme court, and she left texas to seek an abortion elsewhere. movement organizers now expect abortion rights to be a major democratic rallying cry in president joe biden’s reelection campaign. ""the pro-abortion forces, that’s one of the major things they’re going to run on,"" said susan swift, president of pro-life legal and a veteran anti-abortion activist. ""that’s one of the only things that seems to animate their base."" biden campaign officials openly state that they plan to make biden synonymous with the fight to preserve abortion rights. vice president kamala harris has led the charge on the issue for the white house. she will hold the first event in wisconsin on monday, which would have been the 51st anniversary of roe v. wade, the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 u.s. supreme court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. associated press writer alanna durkin richer reported from boston. ap national writer david crary contributed to this report from new york."

""anything that anybody sees, vehicle descriptions, suspect descriptions, anything that they hear – if they want to pass it along to us at 202-727-9099, we’ll happily take whatever information."" alexandria police tell fox 5 this is their ""6th such incident"" since june 2023. officials aren’t saying the dollar amount stolen but dowling says police are working with 7-eleven to fortify their atms. as for the investigation, it's a joint effort between police departments, the fbi, u.s. attorney’s office, all trying to capture these suspects. d.c. policesay they do not think it’s a ring, but multiple people kind of using the same technique to break in. attorney general jason miyares says cracking down on this kind of crime isn’t all up to the police, saying prosecutors need to hold criminals accountable to reduce future incidents. ""criminals become emboldened when they know there aren't punishments for their crimes. if northern virginia and d.c. prosecutors were to consistently enforce consequences for robberies and criminal activity like this, crime would go down and communities would be safer. clear and bold crimes like atm robberies are a consequence of weak prosecutors and a revolving door policy,"" miyares said in a statement to fox 5."

""it’s going to make people safer and more secure. it’s going to make residents and businesses and visitors feel safer and actually be safer in our communities, whether that’s ensuring we can prevent crime before it happens with our access to cameras, ensuring perpetrators are held accountable when they do violate the law and that we’re coordinating within our government to better respond to ensure these retaliatory shootings are not as prevalent,"" said pinto. paul spires is a ward 6 community activist. he disagrees with some components of this bill, but overall he says something has to change. ""some people are not going to like some stuff, some people are not going to get what they want, but this is fair, and we’re in a democracy, we should be able to pull everybody’s words in and bring it to one thing,"" said spire. pinto says this bill was written with hundreds of public speakers and public input from stakeholders in mind, but is encouraging the council to pass it when it’s formally introduced in the coming weeks. fox 5 reached out to each member of d.c. council. some said they hadn’t gotten a chance to read the proposed bill. councilmembers brianne nadeau and robert white said they supported something being put forward. while both tell fox 5 they still have ongoing questions about specific components of the bill, they hear from residents who want something done. white, who introduced a piece of legislation that rolled into this bill, tells fox 5 he wants to make sure the legislation would address the root causes of crime in the district. ""we got good feedback, i’ve been in the community a lot talking about the bills, councilmember pinto and other members have as well. so, from a process standpoint, we’ve gotten a lot of feedback, we’ve had public hearings. people want us to move. and i want us to move as well,"" white said. d.c. mayormuriel bowsersays she supports the measure. ""passing it will support a system that prioritizes safety and accountability. in 2023, we saw pieces of this legislation move our city in the right direction. now we can make those provisions permanent and focus on strategies and policies that will continue to make our city safer. i look forward to signing this bill into law and urge the council to move with urgency to unanimously pass this legislation,"" bowser said in a statement. the american civil liberties union has been outspoken about some of the proposals that wound up in this bill, including giving the ability ford.c. policeto declare a drug-free zone for 120 hours to disrupt open-air markets, certain changes they fear would lessen police accountability and are worried about some changes to favor pre-trial detention for those accused of violent crimes. in a statement to fox 5 wednesday night, those concerns still exist, and they’re hoping d.c. council rejects the legislation as it stands now. ""we urge the d.c. council to reject these and other provisions that put both our safety and our rights at risk. instead, district leaders should build a comprehensive public safety system that focuses on prevention, effectiveness, and accountability,"" the aclu said in a statement. as for what’s next, pinto says she plans to introduce the bill at a committee meeting next week, then the full council will debate the bill. indications are there will not be additional public comment directly to the council but it’s up to council members to express individual concerns and proposed markups to the bill."

"dc snow forecast: potential weekend storm likely to bring snow, cold rain, or mix of both",the d.c. region is welcoming 2024 with our first chance of a winter storm in several years. fox 5’s mike thomas and tucker barnes are tracking the potential weekend storm.,"January 2, 2024 9:31am EST","with 2023 now in the rear view mirror, we are welcoming the new year 2024 with our first chance of a winter storm since about seven inches fell on january 3, 2022. as with any type of precipitation being forecast nearly a week in advance, there are a lot of moving pieces to monitor and things that could change the track of the storm. small changes can mean the difference between snow, cold rain, or a mixture of both. read more:dmv winter 2023-2024 outlook: why we're expecting more snow, chance for blizzards in dc this winter we are watching this upcoming weekend. the window of concern encompasses both saturday and sunday, though at this time the most likely time window appears to be after lunchtime saturday lasting up until the early morning hours of sunday. various weather guidance shows rain from an early start on saturday, to a later start sunday though. this is important as a storm that comes during the middle of the afternoon is more likely to feature some rain/mix which could impact snow totals, while a storm that comes after sunset or overnight is more likely to have more impactful snow. the exact timing will be something to monitor in the days ahead. read more:dc snow forecast: chance for first significant winter storm next weekend in favor of dc snow: 50/50 low & greenland block a feature that weather forecasters watch very closely when forecasting a winter storm in the mid-atlantic and northeast is a feature known as an upper level 50/50 low pressure area. this is a feature known by this name because it resides near the 50° latitude and 50° longitude lines on the globe, just off the coast of nova scotia, canada. this is important because it is essentially what forces cold air southward into the northeast and mid-atlantic. as earth’s atmosphere is constantly in motion, how long this feature is present is what can increase our winter weather chances. that is where the greenland block comes in, an anomalous area of upper level high pressure, which will be strengthening into the weekend. this slows the progression of the 50/50 low northward, so it cannot escape. this results in cold air being filtered southward out of canada and into the northeast. in favor of dc snow: surface high pressure at the surface, cold and dry polar air masses are centralized by strong areas of high pressure. their motions are directed by the upper atmospheric pattern. on thursday, a weak storm will pass south of the d.c. region, perhaps bringing a few showers or a bit of mix to our area. while harmless in terms of accumulations, this storm is the key to what happens next. it is this storm that will turn northward, become energized by the polar jetstream, and deepen into a strong low that will help develop into the 50/50 low that will impact the weekend storm. models have been in good agreement that surface high pressure will be directed southward around the 50/50 low, setting up north of lake ontario. this is key, and this keeps the northeast and mid-atlantic in a prevailing northerly surface wind pattern. this not only forces cold air southward, but traps it due to our proximity to the appalachian mountains. as the weekend storm turns out of the gulf and turns northward, it’s the fact that cold air is trapped at the surface that leads to ice, mix, or snow, depending on the depth of that cold air. while we need to watch for exactly how strong the cold air mass will be when it starts pushing southward, right now most guidance does put it in a rather ideal zone for our region. against dc snow: western pattern getting a good winter storm or blizzard is a lot like making a puzzle: you need all the pieces to fit. right now one of the bigger pieces that is not fitting is the lack of any western ridge component. that is to say, the lack of any strong area of upper level high pressure across the western united states that would buckle the polar jet southward, essentially supercharging our storm system, and dumping even more cold air into the region for the storm to tap into. the pattern appears to be much more zonal, or flat. this is where the upper level winds are primarily west to east, as opposed to more of a northwestern component. this is concerning for a couple of different reasons. the first is that it could allow the storm to trend farther inland in its tracking. this in turn pulls in more of a southeasterly wind as the storm approaches our area. this floods the middle atmosphere with atlantic warmth, with above freezing temperatures pushing coming in above the surface. with high pressure still set to the north of us pushing in the cold, this is a scenario that commonly leads to a cold rain, mix, or ice event as opposed to a pure snow event, or one that changes precipitation types. against dc snow: storm energy another feature to watch with this is the upper atmospheric energy that will lead to the formation of what could potentially be the aforementioned winter storm. right now, that energy is in an area of cold open ocean water in the north pacific, just south of the aleutian islands. this is a part of the world that is notoriously difficult to get reliable data from, due to the lack of direct upper level observation. computers instead do a lot of estimating the strength of features based off of satellite data. the energy from this storm is not forecast to hit the west coast of the united states until wednesday, when it will be more accurately sampled by ground station and balloon measurements. until that point, be weary of snowfall data and storm track data making the rounds on social media, as it is likely to shift and change greatly in the days ahead. after it comes ashore, it is primarily a piece of energy in the southern branch, without any northern component to it. as mentioned above, without an added northern component, the storm may have difficulty strengthening until it gets further to the north. thus, there is a concern that some of these early simulations could show a much stronger storm than will actually be present in a few days, but that will be sorted out in the days ahead. it is something that could vastly impact the forecast, however. what are our early thoughts? with the atmospheric setup, i am not yet convinced that this is the blizzard that many snow lovers have been waiting on since the january 2016 storm put the dc region under a blizzard warning. the storm may not strengthen enough without a polar jetstream enhancement to keep enough cold air in place for the d.c. and baltimore corridor. with the lack of any significant ridge across the western united states, the storm could trend inland and the d.c. region, while they may see some ""bookend"" snow on the front and back sides of the storm, may deal with a lot of mixing with sleet and rain. we will continue to update you throughout the course of the week. right now, the pattern suggests that the risks for the most substantial snows will be west and north of the immediate d.c. region. that doesnotmean there is not any threat for accumulating snow closer to d.c. a few inches is possible, but it may be that some mixing will cut back on totals near the big cities. those along the i-81 corridor and the mountains of virginia and west virginia, however, should keep a keen eye on this weekend's storm, as these are regions most likely to see winter storm totals. as is the normal with just about any winter storm, those in elevated areas will have the best shot at the highest totals, which could be over a foot in the mountain areas. we have several days to monitor this storm, though we most likely won't have a good idea on what the exact track will be until we get closer to the middle of this week, likely later on wednesday or thursday morning when the upper atmospheric energy hits the west coast. until then, be careful what you read on social media. the fox 5 weather team is on it, and we will continue to provide you with timely updates throughout the week."

let's take a look back at the largest blizzards our area has ever seen... the most recent major blizzard to hit our region occurred 8 years ago in the middle of what was actually one of the warmest winters in dmv history. the powerful blizzard buried suburbs like north potomac, md in nearly 40"" of snow. over 100,000 people lost power as winds gusted over 50 mph. nationally, the storm caused ½ a billion dollars in damages and caused the deaths of 55 people. it was a category 5 blizzard on theregional snowfall index scale (rsi), the most extreme category. the storm that would go down in the history books as ""snowmageddon."" it was the most impactful blizzard of the snowiest winter in dmv history. the storm struck on a friday with heavy snow falling well into the morning hours of saturday. elkridge, md saw the highest snowfall totals with just over 38"" of snow, while dulles airport picked up just about 33"". a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, its impact was exacerbated a second blizzard on february 9-10 that added an additional foot of snow in many locations. this was the first storm of the monster 2009-2010 winter that would bring nearly 60"" of snow in total to the area. this blizzard remains the most intense to ever hit our area in the month of december. a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, this storm brought olney, md nearly two feet of snowfall in the days before christmas. enough snow fell that d.c. was still reporting over half a foot on the ground during christmas day. known to many as the presidents' day storm of 2003, this storm could have been significantly worse for the district had sleet not mixed in with the snow during the latter half of the storm. this rsi category 4 blizzard remains the snowiest on record for baltimore, where over 28"" of snow was measured officially. dc, boston, new york and places in-between picked up over a foot of snow, crippling the i-95 corridor. one of only three blizzards to ever receive a category 5 ranking on the rsi scale, this powerful storm dropped over two feet of snow at dulles airport, while parts of the west virginia mountains received four feet of snow. much of the i-81 corridor received over 30"" of snow. the storm is believed to have been a factor in a deadly metro crash at shady grove station. you can also view this look back on youtube. this blizzard, known as the ""megalopolitan blizzard of 1983,"" is remembered widely for its intense episodes of ""thundersnow,"" mostly across maryland during the height of the storm. germantown and frederick, md each received over 30"" of snow, while western loudoun county received as much as 3 feet. a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, the storm is also known for sinking a bulk carrier, the ss marine electric, off the virginia coastline, killing 31 crew. the original president's day blizzard, this storm was known for catching our region completely off guard. weather forecasting has come a long way since the 1970s, but back then the guidance available to weather forecasters did not show a major storm until about 24 hours prior to the first snow falling. after an initial snow of about 4,"" a rapidly intensifying nor’easter brought snowfall rates exceeding 5"" per hour to some locations, and areas within the beltway picked up nearly 2 feet of snow. another winter that featured two blizzards, though the second one in march 1958 mostly impacted areas farther northwest of the d.c. metro area, this blizzard was part of a powerful coastal nor’easter remembered as being one of the worst for portions of the interior northeast. the blizzard buried the dc-baltimore corridor in a widespread 1-2 feet of snow. coming in the midst of what remains the coldest february for the contiguous united states, the storm is remembered for it’s widespread heavy snows across the entirety of the mid-atlantic. even the lower eastern shore, which typically sees warm air aloft keep snowfall rates down due to ocean interference, picked up widespread 12-18"" of snowfall. extreme snow in the mountains followed by continued cold temperatures and a lack of melting were the precursors to the great spring flood of march 1936, which was one of the worst recorded flooding events for our region. what still stands as the snowiest single storm in dc area history happened over a century ago.now infamously known as the ""knickerbocker blizzard"" after the heavy snows caused the collapse of the roof of the knickerbocker theater, killing nearly 100 people who were attending a showing ofget-rich-quick wallingfordduring the height of the storm. it was an extremely rare case of a cutoff-low nor’easter, which caused the storm to move at nearly half the forward speed of a typical blizzard up the east coast. richmond (19""), washington, d.c. (28"") and baltimore (25"") were all paralyzed by widespread 2-3 feet snowfall amounts. this is the worst snowstorm in d.c. history that we have verified data for, though it should be noted that the washington-jefferson snowstorm of 1772 may have been greater, with estimates of widespread 30-36"" of snow made in the journals of the two great presidents. now remembered as the great blizzard of 1899, it occurred during one of the most extreme outbreaks of arctic air ever recorded in the united states, and remembered for just how widespread the snowfall was, particularly across areas of the southeast. snow showers were reported as far south as new orleans, la and tampa, fl. much of florida recorded record cold temperatures as the storm crossed, including miami falling to 29°f. following an initial blizzard on february 8th that dropped 14"" of snow, temperatures plummeted to their coldest on record including -15°f for downtown d.c. while quantico dropped to -20°f. a week later, this second and stronger blizzard added an additional nearly 21"" of snow. by the time the snow was done, d.c. had a official snow depth of 34"" (from both blizzards) which is a record that remains to this day. february of 1899 remains the snowiest month on record for d.c. with 35.2"" of snow. the winter of 1899 was so cold over the eastern united states that ice flowed from the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico. while the blizzard of 1993 did much more damage to the northeast, it had a significant impact on the dmv. download the fox 5 dc weather appto stay abreast of upcoming winter weather & as always,stay tuned to fox 5 dc & the weather team."
dc crime lab partially reaccredited after past failures,"after months of scrutiny, d.c.’s crime lab is now regaining partial reaccreditation after losing its ability to process evidence.","December 26, 2023 10:15pm EST","washington-after months of scrutiny, d.c.’s crime lab is now regaining partial reaccreditation after losing its ability to process evidence. the district hasn’t been able touse its crime labsince 2021. that’s because there were a series of disturbing errors and mistakes, but now the department of forensic sciences is working to turn things around. the certification of accreditation serves as official proof that the d.c. crime lab’s forensic biology and chemistry units are back up and running. that means evidence like dna, fingerprints, and drug testing can be processed. ""that’s really exciting because it means we will be able to better address some of the crime going on here in the district of columbia, said ward 1 councilmember brianne nadeau. to prevent history from repeating itself, councilwoman nadeau wants the government to focus on ensuring protocols are being followed at the d.c. crime lab, and that its leadership listens to the experts. ""there’s a body called the science advisory board,"" she explained. ""i met two members of the board last week who are very concerned about the over politicization about politics leading rather than science in some aspects of the work."" mayor muriel bowserreleased a statement tuesday saying, ""we remain focused on reducing crime and that means ensuring all parts of our public safety and justice ecosystem are working at full capacity. reaccreditation is a critical step in supporting case closure and affording us another tool to advance justice for victims."" for the u.s. attorney’s office, this means bringing charges against suspected offenders. a statement sent to fox 5 from the u.s. attorney's office reads in part: ""accreditation is an important mile marker in the journey towards having testifying experts again."" nadeau believes rebuilding the d.c. crime lab is just one piece of the puzzle to help address the surge in violence, and that’s why she’s also introducing her own ideas, such as increasing rewards for tips about homicides from $25,000 to $50,000; helping police with recruitment; and ensuring d.c.'s 911 call center is operating properly. ""right now, you can’t be assured when you call 911 that you are gonna get the help you need,"" nadeau said. the crime lab's ballistic unit that handles firearm evidence still isn’t reaccredited. no word yet on when that will happen."
lululemon closes navy yard location after recent robbery,"a major retailer has shut its doors at its navy yard location in southeast, d.c.","December 26, 2023 5:14pm EST","washington-a major retailer has shut its doors at its navy yard location insoutheast, d.c. a sign posted on the lululemon store’s doors along tingey street states the store has officially closed, directing customers to its georgetown and f street nw locations. lululemon has not confirmed why it has closed itsnavy yardlocation, though customers speculate whether crime was a factor. clay bartnik and his girlfriend stopped by tuesday, expecting to pick up a late christmas gift. bartnik said he saw the store was closed online but at first, he thought it was due to the holidays. ""we have heard about grab and go’s occurring here, which is kind of weird for the area, i would say. we don’t really hear about that stuff happening in navy yard, but i have seen some surveillance footage and i guess locally it’s happening more and more, especially at this store,"" bartnik said. ""there’s a cvs around the corner that i have witnessed myself grab and go’s occurring. i’m speculating they’re closing due to that."" on dec. 14, d.c. police said three people in masks walked inside the lululemon store in the navy yard and demanded money. one of the suspects was armed with a handgun, according to police. they were able to get away with money and clothing. police confirmed tuesday that no suspects are in custody. ""i can’t imagine their sales or anything are down, especially a national brand like lulu…so it is quite nerve-wracking i would say that a big brand says, like ‘you know what? this isn’t an area i want us to be in operation anymore,'"" bartnik said. ""it’s like, okay is this area somehow declining now that i’m unaware of? since i haven’t experienced that personally. i’m hoping that’s not a domino effect. hopefully, we either get a big name getting back in and filling the area or the stores around here maintain. just a little bit of a gut check."" vanessa fox lives nearby and also stopped by tuesday to see if the store was actually closed, as she read online. ""if it is permanently closed, i’m surprised about that,"" fox said.

5 things you didn’t know about the exorcist,"the exorcist was released on december 26, 1973 – 50 years ago.","December 25, 2023 1:59pm EST","washington-the exorcist was released on december 26, 1973 – 50 years ago. the movie, which takes place largely in the georgetown neighborhood of washington d.c., scared audiences of sold-out shows on opening day, prompting some cities to try and ban the horror film altogether. but in the decades since, the movie has been named one of the best horror films of all time. tourists and locals alike have flocked to notable locations from the film, including the famous (or infamous) exorcist steps in georgetown featured in the final scene of the movie. here are five things you may not have known about the exorcist – and its connections to the d.c. area. the 1974 movie the exorcist was based on a 1971 novel of the same name by american writer william peter blatty. blatty’s novel was inspired by the exorcism of a 14-year-old boy in the 1940s, which blatty learned about when he was a student at georgetown university. the 14-year-old, often referred to as ‘roland doe,’ lived with his family in prince george’s county, maryland. the boy reportedly played with a ouija board his aunt had given him (just like the ouija board regan plays with in the film.) after the death of the aunt, the whole family was subject to household objects moving on their own accord, and a priest was brought in to assist. the story goes that an exorcism was attempted at georgetown hospital, before the boy was taken to st. louis for a second exorcism. before they were known as the ""exorcist steps"" the m street steps near georgetown’s campus were sometimes referred to as the hitchcock steps – in honor of alfred hitchcock. the stairs themselves, which date back to the 19th century, ""always evoked something spooky and suspenseful,"" according to blatty in a2013 usa today interview. the set and production experienced a number of accidents throughout filming. a carpenter lost several fingers while working on the set, leading a professor of theology at georgetown to bless the production. the set itself mysteriously caught fire and had to be rebuilt. nine people reportedly died during the production. jack macgowan, the actor who played burke dennings, died in his sleep not long after the film was finished. ""we were plagued by strange and sinister things from the beginning, it is simply the hardest thing i have ever done in my life,"" said director william friedkin in an interview with the horror magazinecastle of frankensteinin 1974. according togeorgetown university, some 300 students, faculty and staff joined the film as extras. the 1972 georgetown men’s rowing team was featured doing a workout on the exorcist steps. the protestors at healy hall were made up largely of students and faculty. the 97 steps at m street nw, the retaining wall on one side and the old capitol traction station building on the other side were declared a historical landmark in 2019 – but not because of the exorcist. the historic preservation office granted the site historical landmark status instead because of the capital traction station, which was built in the 19th century as a three-story transit hub for four streetcar companies. the building’s soaring clock tower and arched windows also serve as an example pf romanesque revival architecture. the steps and the retaining wall next to the capitol traction station building were included due to the ""historical and architectural significance of the site,"" according to the report. the historical status isn’t due to the steps’ connection to the movie – which at the time were to recent to be considered necessary for protection. either way, the area is protected from modern development in the area both by its historical status, as well as being protected due to its location in the old georgetown historic district. the exorcist 1974 is available to watch for free on pluto tv and sling tv. it is available for rent through amazon prime, apple tv, google play and youtube tv. a new movie, exorcist: believer was released in 2023, and features the return of ellen burstyn as chris macneil. it’s available to watch on peacock."

could dc have a white christmas? here are the odds,"are you dreaming of a white christmas? here are the odds of snow on christmas in washington, d.c.","December 6, 2023 1:33pm EST","washington-with less than three weeks until the christmas holiday, the area is aglow with lit trees, homes, storefronts, and displays. it is everything you see on those holiday postcards minus one key element...the christmas snow. as the famous bing crosby song states, ""i’m dreaming of a white christmas""...but just how much of that hope, is in fact, just a dream? well, i hate to be the grinch to your snowy christmas spirit, but d.c. has never really been a good city for christmas snow. read more:dmv winter 2023-2024 outlook: why we're expecting more snow, chance for blizzards in dc this winter a quick google search will give you the statistic that around 10% of christmases here in d.c. feature snowfall. that number, however, is a little on the high side. in fact, going back to when reliable snow records began in 1888, a full 134 years of christmas snow records, onlyninehave featured any measurable snow on christmas. that’s just under 7% of all christmases that we have records for. we do not just want measurable snow though, we want good snow! snow that you can take the sled out on christmas morning. that christmas card type snow! as you may have guessed, this number is even worse. just three christmases, abouttwo percentof them, have featured snowfall above one inch here in d.c. something that last happened back in 1969 when 4.3"" of snow fell. you do not have to go back nearly as far for flakes falling. in 2020, rain ended with a brief period of mix/snow on christmas day. while a decade prior, back in 2010, it was cold enough that snow flurries were seen in d.c. on christmas day. you have to go back to 2002 for the last measurable snow on christmas day, when the airport picked up just 0.2"" of snow. however, considering that the vast majority of d.c.’s average snow comes during the second half of winter, christmas is just not a very popular holiday for measurable snow as the holiday jingles may have you think. now, if you consider a white christmas to just be snow on the ground, the odds are a little more in your favor! just a hair until 10% of christmases during this same time period featured more than an inch of snow on the ground. thirteen years in total. most recently, who could forget december 2009, when a monster blizzard dropped over sixteen inches of snow on d.c. on december 19th.  it is one of only two cases in over half a century where more than an inch of snow was on the ground on christmas day here in d.c. (1989 being the other, with 2"" already on the ground) december as a whole is just not that snowy of a month. despite being the start of winter, it averages less than two inches of snow total for the entire month, on average here in d.c. going back to 1888, only about 20% of decembers feature more than 5"" of snow in dc. that number nearly doubles in january. in fact, since that monster blizzard in december 2009, d.c. has only picked up more than an inch of snow in the entire month of decemberthreetimes. in fact, it has been three years since dc has picked up any snow in december at all! it takes time for cold to settle in, and an active season storm track to set up. snow is simply much more common is the latter two thirds of winter, as opposed to early winter. so what aboutthisupcoming christmas? are there any hints at whether we will have any chance of seeing any snow around the holidays? as i am sure you are aware, the farther out in time you go in computer weather guidance, the less accurate they become. still, there are some factors that we can look at to give us hints. this includes projections of the upper air pattern, as well as other climate signals. in the short term, there really is not anything to get too excited about in terms of snowfall chances. the two-week pattern, though, does suggest there is one time frame we need to keep an eye on, and that is centered around next weekend, december 16th and 17th. some of the better middle range guidance is showing a transient ridge spike over the pacific northwest into western canada that could displace enough cold air eastward to make things interesting, as the pattern remains very active. this alone does not guarantee a winter storm for our region. with such a progressive, or fast moving pattern, there could be issues with what we call the ""cold air supply"", where the air that comes eastward is colder than normal, but just not quiet cold enough for snow. we will file this under a ""period to watch"" but will not bet the farm on it just yet. looking at the week leading up to christmas, we see that the pattern continues to be progressive. a ridge over the northeast is backing northward, into canada. this will likely be coupled with another storm that will ""fill the gap"" that the atmosphere leaves as this shift occurs in the days ahead of christmas, somewhere in the eastern half of the country. high pressure weakening in the pacific northwest should buckle the polar jet stream southward across the middle of the country while a strengthened subtropical jet stream carries moisture northward.  it is probably going to be a rainmaker for our region, but we will keep an eye on how the pattern evolves. i would not say i am overly excited about our snow prospects in the days before christmas. as we get towards christmas day and the week leading up to new years, things become a little more interesting. the upper ridge lifts and retrogrades back into northwest canada. this is key, because an upper ridge here displaces cold air downstream, to the south and east. at the same time, a vigorous subtropical jet stream shifted eastward, carrying moisture and keeping the storm track active, but this time across the eastern half of the country. this could be the precursor to what could be a period of active wintry weather. while there are never any guarantees in this range, the long range guidance is hinting at this period being when the pattern shifts in a more favorable way for winter weather in the d.c. region. could it be as early as christmas? absolutely. but since guidance like this tends to rush pattern shifts, it is more likely to occur after christmas day. once the pattern does settle in though, the guidance does suggest it may lock in through the first half of january ahead. a hint that this may indeed be the case, is a climate signal that forecasters watch closely, known as the madden-julian oscillation, or mjo. the mjo cycles through eight phases (or is in a neutral setting) and is a measure of large regions of enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, mainly observed over the indian and pacific ocean. the exact location of these areas of upward and downward motion can heavily influence global weather patterns, and are one of the best predictors of long range weather that we have. in the chart above, you can see it is forecast to rotate through several phases, with the key being near the end of the cycle, when you see it swing through phases eight, one, and two. these phases all favor colder air in the eastern united states. the question of whether or not it will bring snow or not remains to be seen! but at this time, the signal are out there that our region is in for a big shift sometime around or just after the christmas holiday. we will continue to monitor any winter risks for you as the holidays approach, and will continue to update you in the weeks ahead!"

""it has nothing to do with the drug zones. if that was the case, a person wouldn’t be getting robbed on 10th and d street on capitol hill, that’s not a drug zone, so what are we talking about here? the tourists, i work in tourism, the tourists are not afraid to come to d.c. because of drugs, they’re afraid of coming to dc because of violence, that’s it,"" spires told fox 5. chief pamela smith spoke to the committee in support of the bill. ""there are significant crimes that are happening here in the district of columbia, one specifically around retail theft. we see a lot of armed carjackings, and also robberies with young people and young adults are using ski masks. this is the legislation that we’re going to need to give our officers additional tools to investigate these kinds of crime,"" smith said. as to the critique about this bill missing the mark on the crime problems, smith said it will give police additional tools to help stop crime.  and in response to the civil liberties concerns, she says the department practices constitutional policing, adding general counsel has reviewed the bill. this bill is one of a few others meant to stem some of the crime problems in the district. the act now bill will continue going through legislative review, and a hearing on some of the other public safety bills will happen in december."

""these transnational terrorist groups are not above paying cartels to sneak sleeper cells across the border for them,"" james told fox 5. ""the cartels are not above taking their money, so it could be a bad mix."" weeks ago,pro-palestinian protesters occupied the canon house office building rotunda, clashing with police. but when hundreds of thousands ofpro-israel protesters gathered on the national mall this week, d.c.’s police chief pamela smith praised the gathering for being peaceful. senate intelligence committee chairman mark warner told fox 5 he’s alsoconcerned about homegrown individuals who may seek to spread violence. ""the focus, in terms of threats to the homeland, would come from a homegrown terrorist or someone that may be inspired by the activities or has sympathy for hamas,"" sen.warner said (d-virginia). with the holiday travel season about to start, both homeland security secretary alejandro myorkas and fbi director cristopher wray are urging congress to re-authorize the federal intelligence surveillance act, which allows them to track terrorist organization communications. both said that ability is a vital tool in stopping attacks."

""although each of these urgent situations are, to some extent, geographically concentrated, the nature of the two emergencies demands city-wide responses,""a releasefrom bowser’s office read. when it comes to the opioid crisis, new data shows that between 2018 and 2022, fatal opioid-related overdoses in the district have more than doubled, from 213 to 461. and in 2022, 96% of these fatal opioid-related overdoses were from fentanyl. as part of the emergency declaration, d.c. agencies including the department of behavioral health, d.c. health, and d.c. fire and ems will be required to input suspected non-fatal overdoses into a common data tracking system. the goal is to strengthen responses by strengthening internal information sharing. bowser’s office says this will ""provide a complete picture of opioid-related fatal and suspected non-fatal overdoses as they occur,"" to help district leadersidentify hotspotsand deploy outreach teams and harm reduction support to them. when it comes to cracking down on juvenile crime, d.c. residents have been calling for action from city leaders and themetropolitan police departmentfor months, if not years. the mayor’s emergency order notes that in the first nine months of 2023, there were 458 arrests of juveniles for robbery, including carjacking, homicide, or assault with a dangerous weapon — a 10% increase from 2022. data also shows that juveniles represent about one-third of the total arrests for carjackings this year, coming in at a staggering 151. fox 5 asked for clarification on this data. according to d.c. police’scarjacking dashboardas of monday, juveniles accounted of 66% of the carjacking arrests, with 863 carjackings reported so far this year. additionally, the mayor’s office says from january to october of this year, 97 juveniles have been shot — 15 fatally — and in just the last five weeks alone, five kids on court-ordered electronic monitoring have been killed. ""this number alone tells us that we have to provide more intervention for kids who are in trouble,"" bowser said during a press conference monday. ""to that end, this public emergency will allow us to increase capacity more quickly and efficiently across the continuum of placements for kids that are ordered by judges into care."" bowser says the district is looking to immediately secure more spaces for placements and address capacity issues within the department of youth rehabilitation services at both theyouth services centersecure facility and youth shelters. part of the order will help speed up construction at the detention center to add ten new beds. it will also incentivize private providers to open additional shelter homes, group homes and shelter beds. another measure in the emergency order calls on the deputy mayor for education and d.c. police to establish safe passage roving teams to reduce school-based violence, as well as deploy ""additional public safety go teams, which shall be community-based, non-law enforcement public safety teams made up of credible contacts including violence interrupters, credible messages, safe passage workers and roving leads to serve district neighborhoods most impacted by youth crime."" in response to the mayor’s order on procurement, georgetown university's juvenile justice initiative policy director, eduardo ferrer, wrote in a statement: ""while increasing capacity at detention facilities might seem like a direct solution, it is fundamentally just another reactive measure that will do nothing to prevent harm or provide kids with the services they need to thrive.  true prevention lies in engaging dc's youth through education, community support, counseling, and proactive programs that build on their strengths and address their needs before they become system-involved.  we must shift our energy from bandaids that focus on controlling and confining youth to long-term solutions that nurture and empower them."" when asked about adding more public safety measures and still not seeing a decrease in crime, bowser said, ""we are just going to keep pushing on all fronts, and we know that as the ecosystem itself corrects, there are more accountability measures, that prevention efforts take hold, it will – it will drive down numbers. we will get there."" not enough space in dyrs facilities became a front-page issue about three weeks ago when news broke thata 15-year-old girlwas arrested in connection with anortheast d.c.carjacking and fatal crash had actually been released from dyrs custody just days before ultimately because there was not enough space at one of the shelters for girls. councilmember trayon white, who oversees the committee that monitors the district’s juvenile detention facilityalways raised concernsabout overcrowding and not enough staffing at ysc. in a juvenile hearing monday morning, a d.c. superior court judge discussed holding the d.c. government in contempt of court, noting the lack of bed space at dyrs shelters for girls was a serious issue the judge brought up about a year ago. ""i mean, we can talk about numbers and otherwise, certainly, if you look over time, the agency has expanded and taken away from bed space, as necessary. we do that based upon population and also being good stewards of the resources we have,"" said lindsey appiah, d.c. deputy mayor for public safety and justice. ""over the past six months, right like by and large for most of those months, there has been no shelter waitlist for girls."" appiah claims not enough shelter space for girls did not become a greater issue until october when four youths were placed on a wait list. meanwhile, bowser says this is a community effort and while the city works to do its part, those charged with caring for these at-risk youth need to step up as well. ""again, i need to emphasize how much the community needs to come together on this issue of young people involved in crime,"" bowser said. ""we need parents and caregivers to make sure they know where their teenagers are and what they’re doing. if you need help with your child, you need to reach out."" the order will remain in effect for the next 15 days."

""we just got to find ways, when the game is tied, to go out there and make the plays and take control of the football game,"" howell said.

""we do know that increased detention, we do know that increased stop and frisk and regressive police practices will not keep us safer, and it will only be performative if we do this, because it will not work,"" said rev. alison dunn-almaguer, executive director washington interfaith network. the u.s. attorney ford.c.,matthew graves, argues the amendment is an important tool in the toolbox. ""what people need to understand is this is a really focused effort. we are not talking about everybody in the city. we are talking about individuals charged with gun offenses or convicted of gun offenses. so in other words, individuals who could be incarcerated,"" graves explained. he also mentioned it could be used for pre-trial release as a condition of release a person has to agree to if entrusted to return to the community. if not, they cannot be released. there were also issues withthe portion of the amendment that would expand the definition of carjacking. ""i understand of thinking through these comments about ‘tougher on crime’ and because i think about carjacking for example, i don’t necessarily see it that way as, ‘okay we need to have tougher sentences. it’s more of an effort to plug a gap,"" pinto stated. in her opening statement, pinto highlighted that there have been 846 carjackings so far this year, as of wednesday, compared to over 200 this time last year. on shootings, pinto said as of wednesday morning, 235 people have been killed with 195 of those murders committed with the use of a firearm. she also noted the city recorded 796 non-fatal shootings so far this year. ""as chief contee used to say, ‘sometimes the only difference between a gun homicide and shooting someone with a gun or shooting into a public space, is a matter of aim.’ and so we have to take all of these matters seriously,"" pinto said. the ward 2 council member believes search provision will help deter gun violence. she claims that according to the u.s. sentencing commission: 68% of firearm offenders are re-arrested. the u.s. attorney’s office submitted the following testimony for the hearing. check it out below:"

""what i don’t want to have happen is have a good director come in, not be able to make the changes that he intends to make – then leave. and the new director will come and say, ‘well i can’t answer for the last person because i’m new.’  and the same thing again, and again and again,"" white added. multiple lawmakers raised concerns about apparent plans by the bowser administration to close up a dyrs oversight office already funded. fox 5 reached out to the mayor’s office about those transparency concerns. director sam abed was tapped by d.c. mayor muriel bowser to lead dyrs over the summer. abed’s history includes previously serving assecretary of maryland’s department of juvenile servicesfrom 2011 to 2023. dyrs has comeunder the microscope recently, especially after the previous treatment of a teen who was arrested in connection with a northeast d.c. carjacking and fatal crash. the incident raised concerns of overcrowding dyrs facilities and its youth detention center. on monday, councilmember trayon white made a surprise visitto the youth services center. after touring the space, and speaking to juveniles, he said the conditions at the center were, ""inhumane."" there are also serious staffing concerns with the youth services center. council members mentioned during tuesday’s confirmation vote, 57 people out of some 250 employees are out on medical leave alone. lawmakers also raised concerns after abrawlbroke out at the youth detention center last week. councilmember white, who has been keeping tabs on dyrs, said that the lack of continuity is a serious issue for the agency. officials told fox 5 dyrs has gone through three leaders this year alone after the mayor had former dyrs director hilary cairns resign in february. juvenile justice activists voiced their displeasure with this move. a council spokesperson confirmed with fox 5 that abed’s confirmation came under emergency legislation and is therefore temporary. it is effective for 90 days before his position has to be readdressed by the d.c. council. in a statement, abed said: ""the primary focus of dyrs is to offer the finest continuum of care for court-involved youth and their families. we are dedicated to empowering our youth, families, and community and are taking every provision to expand our residential placement options for youth under our care. we are fully committed to ensuring the long-term safety and security of our staff members and residents. additionally, the agency has elasticity with respect to bedspace and adjusts its facility configuration to accommodate the detention population ordered held by the courts. we can provide court-involved youth the opportunity to become more productive citizens by building on the strengths of youths and their families in the least restrictive, most homelike environment consistent with public safety."""

""what i would change in the process if i could, is that the da simply making his staff do their job,"" jablonski told fox 5.

""i do think that the idea of collaboration is something that’s always been talked about at the lower level, but it’s important that it’s something that trickles up in these cases, and not down – and that real collaboration happens and not just the lip-service that’s given to it,"" said 8c807 anc commissioner salim adofo. jay brown, a community activist who began the group, community shoulders, agreed with salim and also told fox 5, ""we have people on the democratic side and the republican side who have put their testimony on record. you just can’t put your testimony on record and then not follow through with some type of solution."" the deputy mayor spoke against moving the d.c. crime lab and juvenile division to the feds after making an argument for how d.c. needs to have more control to address crime issues, not less. this is also part of the argument for d.c. statehood, which d.c. congresswoman eleanor holmes norton testified in support of on thursday. after the hearing, u.s. attorney matthew graves told fox 5 in a statement, ""our goal is to get justice for victims. that’s why we are on pace to charge 6,000 cases this year alone and have had nearly 200,000 communications with victims year-to-date about their cases. we will continue to do all we can under d.c.’s criminal justice system to get the best outcome possible for victims."" the u.s. attorney’s office, seeking to clarify comments made in the hearing regarding sentencing for gun possession on federal district court versus d.c. superior court, shared an additional statement which reads: ""the claim that the u.s. attorney’s office could seek higher mandatory minimum sentences if it filed more ""fip"" or felon in possession cases in district court is not accurate.  for violations of the federal law (18 u.s.c.  922(g)), the 5-year mandatory minimum only applies to defendants who possess or use a firearm in the commission of another violent offense.  the d.c. code also provides for a 5-year mandatory minimum for possessing a firearm during a crime of violence.  for offenders charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and no other violent offenses, there is no federal mandatory minimum.  however, the d.c. code imposes a 1-year mandatory minimum in all cases and a 3-year mandatory minimum if the prior conviction was for a crime of violence."""

wednesday, oct. 11. in a wednesday arraignment proceeding, arce-washington’s attorney claimed his client acted in self-defense. he noted that the defendant does not have a violent criminal history. the judge did not make his decision to hold the 28-year-old lightly, even taking a break to review the circumstances. that d.c. superior court judge came back ultimately decided while the 28-year-old like was the victim of a violent crime, there’s probable cause he also may have committed a crime, shooting at suspects as they were fleeing. those talking about this case online raised concerns about vigilantism or more people taking matters into their own hands if crime is not addressed in the city. according to an affidavit obtained by fox 5, the investigation started after shots were fired in the 1600 block of montello avenue, ne, around 11:09 p.m. a patrol officer in the area heard the gunfire and went to investigate. the officer said he saw a man running down the block in his direction clutching his waistband, and the man immediately switched directions when he saw the police cruiser. the officer followed the suspect in his cruiser before getting out and chasing the man on foot. the affidavit says when the officer tackled the suspect, the man pulled a gun out from his pants and threw it into a nearby sewer drain. after he was in custody, the man identified himself as arce-washington and told the officer that he wasn't trying to evade arrest, he had just been running from the scene of a robbery — where he was the victim. during his police interview, arce-washington said the officer's presence may have been what ""saved his life,"" the affidavit states. according to arce-washington, he had just gotten to an airbnb in the 1200 block of queen street, ne, where he was supposed to be meeting up with his girlfriend so they could spend a few days together. he said while he was in his car, he noticed a mercedes coming down the street which he ""thought was strange,"" but didn't think much of it and began to get his things out of the trunk before heading inside. he says that's when he was hit from behind and fell to the ground. arce-washington says he was pistol-whipped and beaten and when he felt the gun pushed up against his face he began to fight back. he says he knocked the gun out of one of the men's hands before they fled. arce-washington got up and started running, saying he believed the mercedes was still in the area and that the incident wasn't over. that's when he saw the police cruiser. in the affidavit, the officer noted that arce-washington had a cut over his right eye and the right side of his head, and other contusions. he was taken to george washington university hospital for treatment. his face still appeared swollen in his wednesday court appearance. additional officers responded to the scene to investigate and found one man in the roadway at the intersection of queen street and montello avenue, ne, who had been shot in the back of the neck. according to police, he was unconscious and barely breathing when fire and ems picked him up. medical officials said he was in critical condition and was paralyzed as a result of the shooting, according to the affidavit. a short time later, a second victim was dumped out of a white suv nearan ambulancethat was on another call at the intersection of florida avenue and eckington place, northeast. he was also transported to the hospital in critical but stable condition and underwent emergency surgery in which a large portion of his intestines had to be removed. after canvassing the area for surveillance cameras, police were able to obtain footage that showed part of the night's events. in the video, police say the two men who were shot were seen running down queen street toward the intersection with montello avenue when a white suv pulls up and stops to let them in. while they're trying to climb inside arce-washington fires 10 shots, hitting both of them. one victim fell to the ground immediately while the other was able to make it into the car, which sped away. arce-washington is seen going over to the motionless man and taking a mask of the victim's face before running off with the gun still tucked in his pants. crime scene investigators say there was a blood trail that led across several blocks. they recovered 10 shell casings from the scene and with the help of dc water, they were able to fish the 9mm gun used in the shooting out of the sewer drain where arce-washington threw it. arce-washington asked for a lawyer after telling his story and according to the affidavit, told police that ""the cameras will show he is telling the truth."" the investigation is ongoing. it's not yet known if charges will be filed against the two men accused of stealing a ps4, clothes and shoes from arce-washington as he claims. for now, he's facing two counts and will be taken to the mpd homicide branch once he's released from the hospital. in another area

""with the stand up of the nightlife task force we've seen a reduction in that type of crime,"" boteler continued. but a search of the metropolitan police department's crime data tells a different story. according to a search of theircrime cards, an online platform that allows users to search for crime type by police district and geographical areas, robberies along the u street corridor increased since the task force started. during the first six months of 2022, before the task force was in place, 45 incidents of robberies were reported in advisory neighborhood commission 1b. over the last six months of 2022, 73 incidents of robberies were reported in anc 1b, an increase of 62%. numbers show 20 more incidents of robberies in anc 1b during the first six months of 2023 when compared to the first six months of 2022, an increase of 44%. even homicides increased in the area after the task force was formed. during the first six months of 2022, only one homicide was reported in anc 1b. that's compared to three reported over the last six months of 2022, and three additional reported in the first six months of 2023. according to the most recent year-to-date crime comparison data for the district as a whole, homicides have risen by 38%, carjackings are up 59%, and robberies have increased by 70%. violent crime in total as of friday, is up 40% compared to the same time last year. boteler also said d.c. police were working with members of the clergy in the area. ""we had clergy out on the u street corridor last weekend walking up and down u street until about 1 a.m. in the morning, engaging with young people,"" he said. ""that seems to have a calming effect sometimes on, on you know, rowdiness."" ""until we can get some more cops on the street, you know, we're utilizing every tactic and effort that we can find out there,"" he said. fox 5 has reached out to metropolitan police department for data clarification but has yet to hear back."
'operation trident': dc leaders announce arrests of 48 individuals in 3-day sting targeting violent offenders,d.c. mayor muriel bowser and law enforcement leaders announced the arrests of 48 individuals in a three-day operation targeting violent offenders with outstanding warrants thursday.,"October 6, 2023 1:18pm EDT","washington-d.c. mayormuriel bowserand law enforcement leaders announced the arrests of 48 individuals in a three-day operation targeting violent offenders with outstanding warrants thursday. officials say ""operation trident"" was a multi-agency effort that took place from oct. 3-oct. 5. themetropolitan police department, u.s. marshals service, federal bureau of investigation washington field office, and court services and offender supervision agency (csosa) worked together to apprehend the wanted individuals, many of whom were on supervised release or probation for other offenses. ""as a city, we know we are seeing juveniles and young adults involved in crimes at a rate that is unacceptable. we are also seeing far too many people on court-ordered supervision who are re-offending. this has been a major concern of ours,"" bowser said the collaborative operation focused on bringing in wanted criminals who had histories relating to narcotics, firearms, crimes of violence, gang activity or sexual offenses. the 48 arrests led to the closure of 72 warrants and 24 additional charges were brought against the offenders. according to mpd, of the warrants, 19 were for failure to appear, 33 were bench warrants, nine were fugitive from justice, two were federal warrants, seven were for parole violations, two were for probation violations and three were for firearms, which were seized. some arrestees were charged with multiple counts for active warrants. ""clearly, there is no more important issue to us in the district of columbia than to keep our city safe and i want to be clear that we’re using every tool at our disposal to drive down crime and to hold people accountable who are committing crime,"" bowser said. the announcement comes as district leaders face tough questions about how they plan to curb the rising crime. there have been216 homicidesin d.c. this year — a 38% increase from 2022. overall violent crime is up 40% and acting police chief pamela smith says this was one step forward in combating what some say isa siege on the city. ""violent crime within the district is predominantly driven by a small number of individuals,"" said acting chief pamela a. smith. ""this week’s operation was a significant step towards combating this violence and bringing peace back to our neighborhoods."" smith says her focus has been on building relationships within the community, with other law enforcement agencies and criminal justice partners including the u.s. attorney’s office to ensure thatviolent offenders and re-offendersare apprehended and prosecuted. ""we are incredibly grateful to our law enforcement partners’ concerted efforts to arrest individuals who have outstanding warrants, the bulk of which were issued because these individuals violated the terms of their pretrial release or probation,"" said u.s. attorney matthew graves said. ""in several of these arrests, firearms were recovered from the person or close by the person, providing more evidence of what we already know: people are arming themselves while they are under supervision. this is unacceptable and must be addressed."" both smith and bowser have repeated the message that they want to get guns off the streets in d.c. and on wednesday, bowser highlighted an issue smith has been speaking about more recently — seeing more disputes and more crew disputes in thedistrictescalating to gun violence. she also called on the d.c. council to makeemergency public safety legislationpassed this summer permanent. during thursday’s news conference, she once again talked about the safer, stronger dc legislation, which she says is meant to address the ""gaps"" in the public safety ecosystem. among many things, the act increases penalties for illegal gun possession and gives the courts more discretion to determine who should be held pre-trial — including defendants previously convicted of a violent crime while they await trial for a new violent crime. bowser also announced a new initiative with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety and justice to launch the $8.5 million safe passage, safe blocks program which will help students living in high-priority areas with commuting to school safely. ""our young people deserve to feel safe and supported, and that includes before, during, and after school. our safe passage, safe blocks program is part of our commitment to youth safety,"" said bowser said in a statement. the mayor says the efforts don’t end here, adding that city leaders and law enforcement are working tirelessly to create a safer d.c. ""there are operations ongoing all day every day,"" bowser said. ""there’s always this collaborative activity that’s meant to keep our community safe."""

""this is a city that’s experiencing in too many places, but not all places, to delia [goncalves’s] earlier point too much gun crime, and robbery. and we’re focused on how to drive that down and hold the people accountable who are doing it,"" said mayor bowser. delia is another reporter who was asking questions about crime – and more so how big events like the world culture fest and art all night are still able to go on safely, but other parts of the city still saw high crime. one thing the mayor noted was that these big events also included dpw and ddot helping. we know there are more federal law enforcement partners involved when events are held on national grounds, all adding to the security footprint. outside of that, mayor bowser highlighted an issue the acting d.c. police chief has been speaking about more recently, and that’s seeing more disputes and more crew disputes in thedistrictescalating to gun violence. the mayor took several questions on crime at a northeast d.c. event on wednesday, celebrating special funding to small h street business owners. just last week, fox 5 spoke with business owners along the same corridor who were completely frustrated with crime after afatal shooting at cru lounge. those business owners told fox 5 that the area crime and nearby open drug market were taking their businesses. a day before that, fox 5 asked the former d.c. council judiciary and public safety committee chair about the council’s previous actions and how that’s impacting public safety today. ""i don’t see the city having a whole government approach and a strategic plan to reduce gun violence. that’s something we’ve talked about a lot. and we also know what we talk about –whether it’s the u.s. attorney and lack of prosecutions,"" said d.c. councilmember charles allen. fox 5 also asked the mayor about his responses. ""i mean i’ve responded to you a thousand different ways,"" she said. ""i don’t know another way to respond to the same question other than to say we’re focused on how to prevent people from getting into crime, how to remove guns from our street and how to make sure people who are using guns are punished. and i further said that i think our ecosystem, including the one that is policy-related, has been disrupted over actions that we have had to reverse over the last several years. we’re starting that process, but we’re not finished. and we’re just going to keep working that we have laws to deter crime. that we have a policy environment – laws that will help us make sure we have the number of police officers that we need. and we’re being responsive to emerging crime trends."" the mayor did share she felt the council went too far in police funding and policies making it harder to attract new officers, when asked whether the crime d.c. is seeing now is due to covid or progressive policies. she also made a pitch for statehood, saying it would be easier if d.c. controlled its criminal justice system. she put it on the council, calling on the body to make emergency public safety legislation passed this summer, permanent. when the mayor talks about her plan to address crime, it’s not exactly one single focus - and this is what she is talking about when she says, ""filling in the gaps."" as an example, in may, the mayor introduced the ""safer, stronger d.c."" bill. one critic called it a ""hodgepodge."" the legislation was actually a package of bills addressing different areas of public safety, like giving judges more discretion to hold adults and juveniles pretrial for a violent offense. some of those measures were included in councilmember brook pinto’s emergency legislation that passed this summer, called""the prioritizing public safety emergency amendment act.""d.c. leaders are working on a temporary version of that bill now. however, those measures are what the mayor is calling on the council to make permanent. councilmember pinto also introduced her""secure dc plan,""which includes some of the approved emergency legislation and goes further. opponents of that legislation argue it expands criminalization. fox 5 spoke with a long-time h street-area community member who goes by, ""jack."" he says none of these measures will mean a thing if the mayor does not focus on one specific area. ""she does a lot. but you’ve got to bring the kids along with communication. let’s start with communication. they have to see their heroes. the guys – the people that they look up to. you know when they see they’re doing things, that makes them want to do things. you’ve got to give them a reason to want to do something,"" jack told fox 5."

""it felt completely amazing,"" kelsey, age 10, said friday. ""my mom has always promised she would take me one day. so we had to do it now that they're going away."" the national zoo's three giant pandas — mei xiang, tian tian and their cub xiao qi ji — are set to return to china in early december with no public signs that the 50-year old exchange agreement struck by president richard nixon will continue. national zoo officials have remained tight-lipped about the prospects of renewing or extending the agreement, and repeated attempts to gain comment on the state of the negotiations did not receive a response. however, the public stance of the zoo has been decidedly pessimistic — treating these remaining months as the end of an era. the zoo just finished a weeklong celebration called panda palooza: a giant farewell. the potential end of the national zoo's panda era comes amid what veteran china-watchers say is a larger trend. with diplomatic tensions running high between beijing and a number of western governments, china appears to be gradually pulling back its pandas from multiple western zoos as their agreements expire. dennis wilder, a senior fellow at georgetown university's initiative for u.s.-china dialogue on global issues, called the trend ""punitive panda diplomacy,"" noting that two other american zoos have lost their pandas in recent years, while zoos in scotland and australia are facing similar departures with no signs of their loan agreements being renewed. beijing currently lends out 65 pandas to 19 countries through ""cooperative research programs"" with a stated mission to better protect the vulnerable species. the pandas return to china when they reach old age and any cubs born are sent to china around age 3 or 4. the san diego zoo returned its pandas in 2019, and the last bear at the memphis, tennessee, zoo went home earlier this year. the departure of the national zoo’s bears would mean that the only giant pandas left in america are at the atlanta zoo — and that loan agreement expires late next year. wilder said the chinese possibly could be ""trying to send a signal."" he cited a litany of chinese-american flashpoints: sanctions imposed by the u.s. government on prominent chinese citizens and officials; restrictions on the import of chinese semiconductors; accusations that chinese-made fentanyl is flooding american cities; suspicion over chinese ownership of the social media platform tiktok; and the uproar early this year over the chinese balloon floating over america. beijing, wilder said, is convinced that ""nato and the united states are lining up against china."" the panda-related tension has even spilled into the hallways of the u.s. senate. last week, pennsylvania democrat john fetterman complained about china buying up american farmland and added, ""i mean, they’re taking back our pandas. you know, we should take back all their farmland."" that animosity has been at least partially shared by the public in china, where anti-american sentiments are on the rise. those sentiments developed into a perfect panda storm earlier this year when le le, a male panda on loan to the zoo in memphis, died suddenly in february at the age of 24. pandas generally live 15 to 20 years in the wild, while those in human care often live to be around 30. le le's unexpected death prompted an explosion on chinese social media platforms like weibo, with widespread allegations that the memphis zoo had mistreated the bear and its female companion, ya ya. the campaign gained intensity when photos circulated on the internet of ya ya looking dirty and gaunt (by panda standards) with patchy fur. an online petition on change.org demanded ya ya be returned immediately, alleging malnourishment and deprivation of proper medical care. slogans such as ""the panda’s life matters"" surfaced in china’s social media along with emotional memes pleading with authorities to rescue the bear. one particular meme depicts a miserable-looking ya ya gazing at a plane flying overhead with the caption: ""mama, i have worked away from home for 20 years. have i earned enough for a plane ticket to return home?"" the heat grew so intense that the memphis zoo released a statement responding to what it called ""misinformation"" about its pandas and stating that ya ya has ""a chronic skin and fur condition"" that ""makes her hair look thin and patchy"" and that le le died of natural causes. even an official chinese scientific delegation that visited memphis and announced that le le was not mistreated and died of a heart condition failed to quell the outrage. ya ya was returned to china on schedule in april when the loan agreement expired and received a celebrity's welcome at shanghai's airport. the chinese government, which gifted the first pair of pandas — hsing hsing and ling ling — to the u.s., now leases the pandas out for a typical 10-year renewable term. the annual fee ranges from $1 million to $2 million per pair, plus mandatory costs to build and maintain facilities to house the animals. any cub born to the pandas belongs to the chinese government but can be leased for an additional fee until it reaches mating age. over the 50 years of american panda loan agreements, the arrangement has hit more than one rough patch. in 2010, daniel ashe, then head of the federal fish and wildlife service, traveled to china to help resolve a technical bureaucratic issue that was threatening the renewal of the national zoo's agreement. the problem was quickly resolved, and the agreement was extended. ""but the situation now is completely different,"" said ashe, now ceo of the association of zoos and aquariums. ""what we’re seeing now is tensions between our governments at a much higher level, and they need to be addressed and resolved at that level."" observers are holding out hope that exactly this sort of 11th-hour high-level intervention will come through. wilder pointed to the upcoming asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in san francisco in november as a potential forum for president joe biden and chinese president xi jinping to make headlines by breaking the deadlock. and chinese ambassador to the u.s. xie feng has sounded semi-optimistic in his public statements. ""i will do my utmost to do that, and here, in aspen, there also will be (pandas),"" xie said during the aspen security forum in july in aspen, colorado. but for now, panda-philes of all ages are making pilgrimages to washington for a last glimpse at the bears. at the zoo on friday, amid the chatter of children, was an adult couple with a baby on the way — each wearing matching panda-ears headbands. colleen blue and john nungesser came from outside philadelphia to see the pandas; this was blue's third time. ""i've been obsessed with them since i was little. i used to just bury people in panda facts,"" she said. nungesser nodded, adding, ""on our first date, she went on and on about pandas."" blue said she broke into tears and ""had a temper tantrum"" when she found out that washington's pandas would be leaving. the couple is already making plans, after their baby is born, to take the infant to see the pandas in atlanta next summer before they leave. and alison lambert, kelsey's mom, said she remains optimistic that both sides will work out an agreement simply because it's mutually beneficial. and if they don't, kelsey is already developing plan b. ""we could always fly to china,"" she said. ""that works, too."" ___ associated press writers seth borenstein and rebecca santana contributed to this report. © 2023 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."

us contractor living in maryland arrested on espionage charges for allegedly spying for ethiopia: doj,"a contractor for the u.s. government has been arrested on espionage charges, accused of providing a foreign country classified information that he downloaded and printed from his work computer system, the justice department said thursday.","September 22, 2023 12:55pm EDT","washington-a contractor for the u.s. government has been arrested on espionage charges, accused of providing a foreign country classified information that he downloaded and printed from his work computer system, the justice department said thursday. abraham teklu lemma, who is originally from ethiopia, had a top secret security clearance and access to classified information through contracting positions with the departments of state and justice. he is accused of using an encrypted messaging application to transmit maps, photographs and satellite imagery to the foreign government, according to court documents. court papers do not identify the country lemma is accused of spying for, and a justice department spokesman declined to comment. but the documents do refer to travel back and forth over the past year and a half to a country where he has family ties. the new york times, which first reported the arrest, identified ethiopia as the country for which lemma is alleged to have spied. prosecutors say he accessed dozens of intelligence reports, copying information from them and downloading it to cds and dvds. lemma faces charges of delivering national defense information to aid a foreign government and conspiring to do so, as well as the willful retention of national defense information. it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. lemma, 50, of silver spring, maryland, is a naturalized u.s. citizen, the justice department said. besides the material that prosecutors say lemma provided, he also communicated with a foreign official who tasked him with supplying information on certain subjects of interest to the country. they discussed military issues, such as command centers and the activities of rebels who were fighting against the government, according to an fbi agent's affidavit. when the official told lemma last september that it was time for him to continue his support, the affidavit says, lemma responded, ""roger that!"" the state department said in a statement that it learned that lemma may have improperly removed classified information from its systems during an internal 60-day security review prompted by the april arrest of a massachusetts air national guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents on a social media platform. the department said it would continue to implement recommendations from that review to improve its protection of classified information. ethiopia's federal government in late 2020 went to war with authorities in the country's tigray region, teaming up with the military of neighboring eritrea. tigray was cut off from the world for much of the conflict that ended with a peace deal in november, meaning satellite imagery was a crucial source of information on the fighting. hundreds of thousands of people were killed. united nations-backed experts say the situation remains ""extremely grave"" even now, with eritrean fighters still present. ap writer cara anna in nairobi, kenya, contributed to this story. © 2023 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."

""i really urge you to think about why it happened so you can address it and ensure it never happens again,"" reyes said. dodge hellonen, now 24, was the first of the threemarinesto be punished for participating in the capitol siege. reyes also is scheduled to sentence co-defendants micah coomer on tuesday and joshua abate on wednesday. the three marines — friends from the same unit — drove together from a military post in virginia towashington, d.c., on jan. 6, when then-president donald trump spoke at his ""stop the steal"" rally near the white house. they joined the crowd that stormed the capitol after trump urged his supporters to ""fight like hell."" before imposing hellonen’s sentence, reyes described how marines fought and died in some of the fiercest battles in american history. she recited the number of casualties from some of the bloodiest wars. prosecutors recommended short terms of incarceration — 30 days for coomer and 21 days for hellonen and abate — along with 60 hours of community service. a prosecutor wrote in a court filing that their military service, while laudable, makes their conduct ""all the more troubling."" reyes said she agreed with prosecutors that hellonen’s status as an active-duty marine does not weigh in favor of a more lenient sentence. but she ultimately decided to spare him from a prison term, sentencing him to four years of probation. reyes said it ""carried a great deal of weight"" to learn that hellonen maintained a positive attitude and stellar work ethic when he was effectively demoted after the jan. 6 attack. he went from working as a signals analyst to a job that few marines want, inventorying military gear. ""the only person who can give you a second chance is yourself,"" she told him. ""i take full responsibility for my actions and i’ll carry this with me for the rest of my life,"" hellonen told the judge. hellonen, coomer and abate pleaded guilty earlier this year to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a capitol building, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of six months behind bars. hundreds of capitol rioters have pleaded guilty to the same charge, which is akin to trespassing. hellonen was carrying a yellow ""don’t tread on me"" flag when they entered the capitol through a door that other rioters had breached about seven minutes earlier. after walking to the rotunda, they placed a red ""make america great again"" hat on a statute and took photos of it. they remained inside the capitol for nearly an hour, joining other rioters in chanting ""stop the steal!"" and ""four more years!"" none of them is accused of engaging in any violence or destruction on jan. 6. but prosecutors said none of them has expressed sincere remorse for their crimes. coomer bragged on social media about taking part in ""history,"" called for a ""fresh start"" and said he was ""waiting for the boogaloo,"" a slang term for a second civil war in the u.s. coomer’s statement that he was ""hoping for a second civil war to topple what he viewed as a ‘corrupt’ government was deeply ominous, given that his military training and access to military weapons would make him a particularly effective participant in such a war against the government,"" the prosecutor wrote. the associated press contributed to this report."

""he was an enthusiastic foot soldier,"" prosecutor erik kenerson said. u.s. district judge timothy kelly noted that pezzola, of rochester, new york, was a newcomer to the group who didn’t write the kind of increasingly violent online messages that his co-defendants did leading up to the jan. 6 attack. still, he was in some ways a ""tip of the spear"" in allowing rioters to get into the capitol, said the judge, who decided to apply a terrorism enhancement to the sentence. ""the reality is you smashed that window in and let people begin to stream into the capitol building and threaten the lives of our lawmakers,"" the judge told pezzola. ""it’s not something that i ever dreamed i would have seen in our country."" defense attorneys had asked for five years for pezzola, saying that he got ""caught up in the craziness"" that day. pezzola testified at trial that he originally grabbed the officer’s shield to protect himself from police riot control measures, and his lawyers argued that he broke only one pane of glass and that it was other rioters who smashed out the rest of the window. he told the judge that he wished he’d never crossed into a restricted area on jan. 6, and he apologized to the officer whose shield he took. ""there is no place in my future for groups or politics whatsoever,"" he said. but later, as he left the courtroom, he raised a fist and said, ""trump won!"" another proud boy, former chapter president ethan nordean, of auburn, washington, is also set to be sentenced friday. prosecutor are asking the judge to sentence him to 27 years. two of their co-defendants were sentenced thursday to a couple of the longest prison terms handed down yet in the jan. 6 attack. joseph biggs, an organizer from ormond beach, florida, got 17 years, and zachary rehl, a leader of the philadelphia chapter, got 15 years. the proud boys’ triallaid bare far-right extremists’ embrace of lies by trump, a republican, that the 2020 election was stolen from him. more than 1,100 people have been charged with capitol riot-related federal crimes. over 600 of them have been convicted and sentenced. the longest jan. 6-related prison sentence so far is 18 years for stewart rhodes, founder of another far-right extremist group, the oath keepers. six members of that anti-government group also were convicted of seditious conspiracy after a separate trial last year. the associated press contributed to this report."
teen charged in fatal stabbing over sweet and sour sauce to remain in jail: judge,a second d.c. superior court judge refused friday to release the 16-year-old girl charged in connection with fatally stabbing naima liggon.,"September 1, 2023 6:59pm EDT","washington-a second d.c. superior court judge refused friday to release the 16-year-old girl charged in connection withfatally stabbing naima liggon. a d.c. police detective testified in court that the stabbing started with an argument over mcdonald's sweet and sour sauce. the teenage suspect, facing second-degree murder among other charges, was ordered to remain in a secure juvenile facility until trial is expected to begin in october. she was also ordered to undergo a psych evaluation. the hearing was held on the same day the district will begin a juvenile curfew enforcement pilot, impacting kids who are 16 years old and younger. we’ll never know if that pilot program could’veprevented the aug. 27 early morning murder. however, the timeframe of the fatal stabbing – happening at around 2:10 a.m. sunday – and the scene where the stabbing happened – along the u street corridor – are both being targeted in this pilot curfew. the u.s. attorney for d.c., matthew m. graves, announced this week that he instructed his team to pursue adult charges against 16 and 17-year-old robbery and carjacking-spree suspects. d.c. mayor muriel bowserwas asked about the changes at a press event thursday . ""i didn’t have the conversation with the u.s. attorney, so i’m quite sure if he said it he has some trend information or data to suggests that that’s the appropriate prosecution journey. i would welcome him to have that conversation with all of us,"" mayor bowser said. ""i think we need both prosecutors in the district to take this seriously. none of us want to be in a position where we’re teaching children that there are no consequences for bad activity because if we don’t teach them, they’re going to learn it one way or another. and they’re going to learn it, unfortunately by going to a hospital, going to a funeral, or going to jail."" mayor bowser did not directly answer fox 5’s question regarding whether she felt the fatal 16-year-old stabbing suspect should’ve been charged as an adult. the teen is currently facing second-degree murder as a juvenile. fox 5 spoke with the mother of a 15-year-old shooting victim whose murderer could not be charged as an adult because of d.c. law. that mother told fox 5 she feels like cars are being valued more than lives. the u.s. attorney’s office told fox 5 that they have a number of homicide and shooting cases wherejuveniles have been charged as adults. they explained that the usao’s comments earlier were not new but more to reaffirm the position crimes they can pursue adult charges on, based-on previously agreed policy. ""we agree with many of our elected leaders who believe that juveniles should generally be treated as juveniles. butarmed robberies and armed carjackingsare serious offenses that we have unfortunately seen recently, sometimes escalate to homicides,"" u.s. attorney matthew m. graves said on wednesday. catherine abodo, a concerned parent, told fox 5, ""i think if we are more strict with the punishments, we will see less crime. i think we should also hold the parents accountable to some degree."" the pilot curfew starts at 12:01 a.m. saturday, sept. 2. the curfew will be enforced from 12:01 to 6 a.m. on saturdays and sundays. from sunday to thursday, the kids will have to be inside from 11:00 p.m. to 6 a.m. there will be targeted enforcement at the seven specific areas below: police will be taking the teenagers or kids who don't abide by the rules to the youth services center instead of to the police station, so that families can get dyrs help, and officers can get back to patrols. eduardo ferrer, policy director at georgetown university's juvenile justice initiative, told fox 5 in an emailed statement: ""it is both alarming and disheartening to see the adoption of a curfew that scapegoats and targets our youth. research clearly demonstrates that the use of police for curfew enforcement is an impractical and ineffective allocation of mpd resources that will disproportionately harm black youth. this proposal is yet another example of the administration's preference for reactive, policing-centered measures and their lack of a real plan to meet the needs of our children and families as they struggle to recover from the impact of the pandemic. we will not meet the needs of the day by resurrecting the failed policies of the past."""

""you don't make a threat on a place that you feel connected and involved and supported,"" klinger said. ""i think schools need to really realign the conversations around school safety and violence prevention and not just have it always be react, react, react."""
