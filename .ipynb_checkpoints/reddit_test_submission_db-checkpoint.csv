I saw moments of love and unwavering companionship, however fleeting and insignificant they may have been to the rest of the world.

This is like the 5th incident this month, at least. I’ve tried calling and texting him about it, I tried talking to him in person and at first he was understanding… but the last interaction we had about his dog barking at night and keeping me awake, was on the hostile/aggressive side (from him.) So now I’m a bit afraid to talk to him in person about it again.

 I requested almost 2 weeks ago that he not leave his dog outside past midnight. Well, the dog was barking non stop all last night, so clearly talking to him is not gonna stop it. I tried calling 311 and he wasn’t home so that did nothing.

A buddy and I drove up from DC for a hiking weekend in West Virginia. We went to a diner for breakfast, and were seated next to a couple of hunters from Pennsylvania. We chatted a bit with the hunters about how their bow-hunting was going, and they seemed like nice guys. Then another hunter who was local from the WV town came and joined them. They jokingly told him, ""Hey, make sure and be polite, we've got some folks from DC over there."" I joked back, ""Yeah, we're the deep state!"" (I'm a federal worker and my friend is a contractor.) The guy frowned and said something hostile-sounding, like, ""People from Washington DC might not get treated very well here.""

I didn't really know what to say. I kind of shrugged and was like, ""Uh ... Everyone's been really nice so far?"" Then we just continued kind of being friendly and chatting off and on with the hunters in between talking with each other - they asked where we were staying and we told them about our Airbnb and how crazy the real estate prices seemed to be and so on. When it was time to pay, the waitress looked at us like we were the scum of the earth. I don't know, it just felt like a really weird vibe. I've been out to various West Virginia towns for weekend getaways probably five or six times, and nothing like that ever happened before. 

I was just curious whether anyone else has experienced something similar in the past - people seemingly mad at you just for being from DC, without knowing almost anything else about you?

Then, when I was driving back into DC, I followed a giant militant-looking black pickup truck with a big death's head skull/American flag logo on it through my peaceful, bucolic northwest DC neighborhood - you don't usually see that on our neighborhood streets, since a giant truck like that could never succeed at parallel parking in these parts, so it really stuck out. I see those kinds of trucks all the time on my frequent travels down south to visit family. It just made me wonder, is that going to be the future of vehicles you see on the streets of DC come January?

This article, while a few years old now, hits on many of the issues with this regressive policy (https://ggwash.org/view/83739/why-do-some-dc-residents-receive-free-trash-collection-but-not-others), and it honestly seems very difficult to argue against changing these rules in good faith.

  
For reference, our fees have nearly tripled over the last 3 years since Republic Services bought Tenleytown Trash. The customer service is awful, the communication is non-existent, and they consistently raise our fees by 20-30% each year without notice or justification beyond the bill we receive. As individuals, the best we can otherwise do is jump between a very small number of alternatives, but if the city were to handle this at scale (like most metropolitan areas do), they would have sufficient leverage to stop the price gouging and hold the third parties accountable for terrible service.

  
I'd love to hear any feedback and/or additional experiences you all have had dealing with these companies and ideas for getting this on the radar of our ward representatives so that we can finally see some change here.",False,False,washingtondc,Condo trash services,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1gz0nw5/condo_trash_services/

Why it hits different:

* The witch prophecies feel like a medieval version of DC insider trading tips
* Lady Macbeth's descent into madness is scarier than Metro at rush hour
* The music conductor was going so hard his sweat was visible from the cheap seats
* You get to dress up (you don't have to) and feel fancy AF in one of DC's most gorgeous buildings

Hot take: Opera gets a bad rap as boring/stuffy, but this production is more engaging than half the ""networking events"" in Navy Yard. Plus, the Kennedy Center's bars are actually decent and you don't have to fight the Adams Morgan crowds.

I was born and raised on the west coast and moved to the DC area two years ago. I am absolutely shocked by the behavior of drivers in this area. I’m terrified to drive based solely on the experiences I have had being a passenger while my partner has been the driver. For context, my partner grew up in the DC area. 

Over the past couple of months, I feel like it has gotten progressively worse. Has anyone else experienced the same?

Last month, we were driving in Maryland on a three lane road. Someone in the right lane was swerving into our lane (the middle lane), so my partner accelerated to try to get away from them and avoid an accident. This person then sped up, and did the same thing again. We looked over in shock as the man was steering purposefully into our lane, trying to hit our car. My partner laid on the horn to alert them to stop swerving. They then drove in front of us, cut us off, and stopped in between two lanes of traffic, got out of their car, rolled up their sleeves, and tried to approach our vehicle - we drove off and got away from the situation. 

Tonight, in Alexandria, my partner flashed his headlights to alert a car heading in the opposite direction that their headlights were off. This person turned their lights on, flashed them at us, and flipped us off as they drove past.

Hello neighbors, I’m a member of the IUEC Local #10, conservationists, and ethical deer hunter. 

I’m reaching out to the community to ask for permission to hunt whitetail deer on private property in the DC area where hunting may not currently be taking place. My goal is to help manage the local deer population in a way that benefits both the environment and the community.

In areas without natural predators or active hunting, deer populations can grow unchecked. This can lead to a range of issues, including:
	•	Overgrazing: Deer consume large amounts of vegetation, which can disrupt native plant communities and degrade habitats for other wildlife.
	•	Damage to Ecosystems: Overbrowsing by deer can prevent forests from regenerating and harm biodiversity.
	•	Increased Human-Wildlife Conflicts: High deer populations can lead to more vehicle collisions, property damage, and the spread of tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease.

Ethical, regulated hunting is an effective way to help control deer populations, reduce environmental strain, and maintain a healthier balance in local ecosystems. I am a responsible hunter who follows all legal regulations and practices humane methods. If you or someone you know would consider granting permission for this purpose, I’d be happy to discuss details and address any concerns.

Thank you for considering this request, and I appreciate your support in helping to preserve our shared environment.

DC, you're next. I'm asking the DC community to help find me a wall. Any recommendations or leads will be highly appreciated.

I recently lost a cat in my life unexpectedly. I'm not looking to adopt right away, so that I can properly grieve. I adopted her in late 2022 just a little over a month after losing my other cat. I realized quickly that I was not emotionally prepared to adopt, but my new buddy and I made it work for nearly two years.

The grief this go around isn't nearly as intense as in 2022 (which comes with it's own set of guilt), but I don't want to risk harming the bonding process with a new buddy by adopting too soon again.

All of that being said, I really want to be intentional about what my 'wants' are going into the process. I know I want a lower energy cat and preferably a cat that would thrive as a single. My lease only allows for one.

I'm wondering if folks had advice on how to best go about the adoption process? There are so many animals in need of a home, and I want to make sure I can set mine up for success by choosing one that is most likely to thrive in my kind of space.

the last time I adopted, I applied for a specific cat. I'm wondering if anyone has insight on whether shelters can help play 'matchmaker' in a sense? I reached out to HRA but I haven't heard back. I assume they have their paws full at the moment and I am not in any type of urgency. I've never done a cat cafe experience - has anyone successfully adopted through one? What was that like?

Thank you so much.

**WHAT?**

We are an informal meetup group gathering at bars around the District. All we want is to socialize after a long week and make new friends. All are welcome - whether you’re an old school Washingtonian, a recent transplant, or (gasp) not a Redditor, this group is for you!

**A SPECIAL NOTE:**

This happy hour is meant for people to gather and feel comfortable interacting with folk, both new and old. You can, and will, be asked forcefully to not return if you are being a massive dick or an active creep! Please let the host or guest host know if you feel uncomfortable or in danger from any participant, whether it's to the level where you want someone to be on the lookout to bail you out of a conversation if they approach you again or if you think they shouldn't be allowed to return.

Respect people's personal space always, as well as a no when it's given to you. And don't be a stereotypical Redditor when it comes to talking to women in particular--this is not a place to pick up a date.

Yes, measuring how big of a dick or a creep one is being may be a subjective thing, and similarly, yes, I do not care about that!

I'm planning to come to Washington DC on a solo trip right after Christmas, till the New Year! I've wanted to visit this city for a while but haven't gotten the time until now (I was told prices are also cheaper).

I booked my flight that's set to arrive around 10:30 pm, but I didn't realize the WMATA closed as early as 11:10 pm (I don't think I can make it). However, the schedule may differ since it may count as the holidays... They haven't released their schedule yet on their website last I checked.

UBER and Lyft seem to be the only options after the last Silver Line train, and the prices are expensive from what I've seen (From Dulles Airport to Washington DC downtown). I've tried looking at whether there are buses as well, but they all seem to be out of service by the time 11:00 pm rolls around. Are there any other options that I'm not considering?

Having booked my stay already, I'm considering cancelling one night at the Airbnb and staying at the airport overnight, before taking the first train at 5:00 am. The UBER ride is costing almost as much, if not more than a one-night stay at my Airbnb due to the CAD to USD conversion. :(

Appreciate any insights, thanks and looking forward to exploring your beautiful city!

However, now that we have fully settled in and decorated etc at the 9 month mark in our 12 month lease, we have just gotten word that our landlord might put the house up for sale.

I'm a bit exhausted by renting at this point, so my husband and I were considering buying it when it came up for sale. This would be our first home, and while we make decent salaries for the area, some recent medical expenses, job lulls, and our recent wedding have dug into our savings a bit. I'm thus considering whether an FHA loan might be the way to go, or if there are other long-term costs with that that I'm unaware of. 

Another key consideration in this entire exchange is the fact that the house includes a basement apartment that will be sold with it. We like our basement apartment neighbor very much and would love to just keep her on (also so she wouldn't have to move--she also wants to stay). But as first time homebuyers, I'm sure you can understand that we have also never been landlords, which brings up a whole other set of questions. 

I guess my general asks fall in two main categories. As DC residents, what should we consider when buying our first home here? Are there assistance programs, grants, credits, etc that I should look into? 
Note that the house is over 100 years old and needs fixing up/some critical repairs because our landlord is a bit of a slumlord, so we're looking for any help we can get here.

Second category, what do I need to know before taking on being a DC landlord to my basement neighbor? 

Also, I guess bonus category, a realtor told us that this property falls under TOPA tenants rights. What does that mean for us?

I am going to be visiting a friend near D.C during the Inauguration, will be there a while but the inauguration is during the time im there. I am really considering going, as it could very well be the only time im ever in the area during that week.

I’m just wondering if it’s worth the experience of attending because it is objectively a once in a lifetime potential thing. Has anyone attended one and could review the experience? Not many vlogs or discussions on other sites about it either.

Also, here is the text of my open letter to the WMATA Board:

Dear WMATA Board:

My name is Harold Christy. I am a US Army combat veteran; a DC homeowner, voter, and taxpayer; and a near-daily Metro rider. I am currently employed as an investigator with the D.C. Office of the Inspector General. Prior to that, I spent twenty-five years with the United States Secret Service.

I am writing because of an incident that occurred on a Green Line train on July 16, 2024. I was traveling home from work and had just boarded the train at Navy Yard. While I was standing by myself, minding my own business in my suit, holding a briefcase and reading a magazine, individuals aboard the train began to play extremely loud and obscene music while dancing and aggressively panhandling in the aisle—all in clear violation of WMATA regulations and D.C. law. Their actions deprived me and the other paying passengers of the peaceful enjoyment of this common conveyance, and restricted our movements, as the dancers' erratic motions effectively occupied the entire space. While these dance crews are a common occurrence on the New York City subway, they have only recently emerged on Metro, possibly because of the 'depolicing' that many DMV jurisdictions have been practicing.

It should be noted that subway dancing for money violates multiple DC criminal statutes, including 22-1321 (disorderly conduct), 22-2302 (a) and (b) (aggressive panhandling), 35-251 (unlawful conduct on public passenger vehicles), 22-2001 (false imprisonment), and 22-404 (assault).

Outraged by this behavior, I demanded that the dancers stop their criminal and dangerous activity. They ignored my objections and continued to dominate the space with their movements and violent music. When the train reached Waterfront, I attempted to push one of the individuals off the train, to stop the unlawful, harmful activity and because I was in apprehension of imminent offensive contact to me and the other passengers in the area. The other dancer grabbed me from behind and violently threw me toward the opposite door. When the door eventually opened, I succeeded in extricating myself from the car.

It should be noted that I never let go of my briefcase, because it contained my official OIG laptop. Therefore, everything I did that day, I did one-handed.

After their violent acts against me, the dancers, as shown in WMATA surveillance video, continued to perform between Waterfront and L'Enfant Plaza, ceasing their performance just before arriving at the latter stop so they could walk the aisles and solicit funds from the passengers who had just watched them throw a grown man off the train.

According to an affidavit by an MTPD detective, these individuals who were engaged in obviously illegal activity then had the audacity to complain to WMATA Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD). Officers responded, interviewed at least one dancer and witness, and, even though the dancer admitted to violating the above criminal statutes while relating his version of events, MTPD did not arrest or even ticket the dancer. Rather, MTPD conducted a high-tech investigation, analyzing train-car and station video to determine my movements and pulling Metrocard records to identify me and place an alert in the turnstile system. In other words, they started a 21st-centruy manhunt for a man in a suit with a briefcase. For defending himself and others.

My next commute home from work, paying with my Metrocard again in spite of the packs of idlers who still jump even the new, higher turnstiles, I was met by three MTPD officers who had staked out the Navy Yard station based on my predictable pattern of life (most people with jobs and homes have a predictable pattern of life. This is why it is easier to investigate and prosecute law-abiding citizens than street criminals). They conducted a field interrogation of me, in front of the other commuters, and sent me on my way.

Several weeks later, I was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor assault and spent a day in leg irons, a belly band, and handcuffs while waiting for my arraignment in Superior Court. For defending myself and others.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is now prosecuting me for this misdemeanor criminal offense. Under DC law, because the maximum sentence is 180 days, I am not even entitled to a jury of my peers, but rather the sterile legal analysis of a judge. For defending myself and others.

It appears that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, WMATA and MTPD are content to see ""all the laws but one to go unexecuted."" I am glad to see that MTPD seems to be getting away from the days of depolicing. However, selectively prosecuting a paying passenger for reacting to rampant, unsafe, unlawful conduct is the wrong way to start this process. It places your ridership on notice that our role is to pay our fares, sit down and shut up, while the few malefactors among us make the stations and cars a horror show of unlawful and hazardous conduct.

No wonder every lawyer I have spoken to in my Superior Court odyssey has admitted to never riding Metro.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that you will do something to improve matters.

She transferred the funds into a Chase bank account. According to her, they marked the transfer as suspicious and froze the account. A month later, they terminated her account and she wasn't able to get the funds back. 

  
I advised her to file a claim with the FDIC in the beginning of November. The month beforehand, she told me (did not make a notarized contract) that she would create a contract to reimburse us. After ghosting me for days on end when I would ask her for proof of her notarization or FDIC claim, she told me that her order would come Friday. Last minute, she also claimed that me and my roommates would only receive 250 back. If any of us attempted to file with small claims, she also said she would counterclaim for more than $2500 (the overall amount of the security deposit). 

  
Although she failed to provide an itemized set of damages, she claimed that the money would be withheld for a myriad of reasons, including the following: 

\- The emotional damages of not informing her that my cat was pregnant. (I didn't know and she was the first person I informed). According to her, this brought her emotional distress because it triggered her PTSD with an abortion 

\- Forcing her to clean the house and leaving it in ""unsanitary conditions."" She argued that I was neglecting my cat and overfed her constantly, which led her to complaining about the litter box because her feces were huge. She also left a pile of dishes in the sink, which grew mold as people waited for her to come back. 

 \- Smoking in the house (I never smoked in the house and she doesn't even know who was. She also has a medical card). 

\- Being ""violently confronted"" by one of my roommates (although this reaction was warranted and there was no proof of physical damage). I have generalized anxiety disorder, just like her, and loud noises are one of my triggers

The money that I used for my security deposit is scholarship money. I signed a contract that legally stated that the money can only be used for individual purposes (tuition, rent, transportation, etc). Her claiming this money is not only a violation of tenant rule, it is also a violation that can get me in trouble and put me in a situation of academic jeopardy.

1) say I get the 2.50 version at $80, and I take 32 trips with it in a month. Would a $6.75 trip then be free, or are the only free trips still going to be at $2.50?

2) Subsequentially, if I don't want to pay over 200 for the full 6.75 trips, could I get the 2.50/80 one and then just go in and out of the gates and catch the next train?

Most recently, I was waiting for a car in front of me that stopped at a crosswalk and the driver waiting to cross the lane threatened to ram me twice. But, where could I possibly move to? I stayed put.

It's a senseless place to drive but this particular behavior blows my mind. And I suppose it's not enough of an issue to attract law enforcement.

A few things I would have like to have seen happen (and, yes, much of this isn’t directly under the mayor’s purview, but not blaming everything on the feckless feds should be part of the job description):

1. A crosstown Streetcar line from the Georgetown Waterfront to East Cap and JBAB

2. 295 buried (a la Boston’s Big Dig and the northern section of 395) and the adjacent railyards moved somewhere else

3. 395/695 buried

4. RFK torn down with a public park and rec facilities in its place

5. Poplar Point developed (maybe into a stadium, park or something useful)

6. Kenilworth Park fields developed into usable playing fields

7. Rock Creek Park amphitheater redeveloped

8. East St. Elizabeth’s developed into something

9. C&O Canal in Georgetown developed into a tourist attraction (rather than an empty pit) - this did happen, but was reversed due to factors beyond the mayor’s control admittedly

10. Legal swimming in the Anacostia and Potomac, with beaches like we had back in the 1890s!

11. Foundry Branch Trestle & Palisades Trolley Trail developed

Happy hour deals: Alas, none after 6pm! Bring your own happiness or share a friend's

Convenient to the Green/Yellow lines @ Mt Vernon (celebrate the post-NATO station reopening!)

**WHAT?**

We are an informal meetup group gathering at bars around the District. All we want is to socialize after a long week and make new friends. All are welcome - whether you’re an old school Washingtonian, a recent transplant, or (gasp) not a Redditor, this group is for you!

**WHO?**

We’ll be there starting at 6:00pm. Each week's host will let you know where we are in the bar and who to look for. Keep in mind that we may move around, so check the comments for updates.

**A SPECIAL NOTE:**

This happy hour is meant for people to gather and feel comfortable interacting with folk, both new and old. You can, and will, be asked forcefully to not return if you are being a massive dick or an active creep! Please let the host or guest host know if you feel uncomfortable or in danger from any participant, whether it's to the level where you want someone to be on the lookout to bail you out of a conversation if they approach you again or if you think they shouldn't be allowed to return.

Respect people's personal space always, as well as a no when it's given to you. And don't be a stereotypical Redditor when it comes to talking to women in particular--this is not a place to pick up a date.

Yes, measuring how big of a dick or a creep one is being may be a subjective thing, and similarly, yes, we do not care about that!

As I'm sure some people know, a lot of gray market places are transitioning into medical dispensaries that will require you to have a card for entry. I also know that you can self-certify your application to get a card through the DC government.

I do not work for the fed or the DC government and am considering self-certifying because, like many others, I use cannabis products to help me sleep and for anxiety. Admittedly, I do also use it for entertainment. With that said, I have worries that this will somehow impact my job prospects in the future. I don't ever plan to work for the fed but something tells me that having my name on a list might not be wise. Are these worries unfounded? Is it better to be safe than sorry? (I.e., just not apply for self-certification)

Additionally, I notice the self-certification application form makes you check a box for the following statement: ""I will only use cannabis purchased from a DC dispensary as a qualifying patient for the treatment of a qualifying medical or dental condition or for the side effects of a qualifying or medical treatment. I understand my rights and obligations as set forth by the Medical Cannabis Program and agree to these requirements. I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Willfully making a false statement that is, in fact, material, in writing, directly or indirectly, on this application is a violation of District of Columbia law and subject to criminal penalties of a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or both. (D.C. Official Code § 22-2405)."" -- I really don’t intend to break the law but I honestly don't know the ramifications for purchasing cannabis with a medical card with the intended use of entertainment. How enforced is this?

Has anyone self-certified that can speak to their experience or shed any light on this? 

TLDR: what are the practical ramifications of self-certifying my application for a medical cannabis card through the DC govt? I do not work for the fed or any other government but am worried about the consequences of having my name on list re jobs and the legal consequences if I buy for entertainment (not medical purposes) using the card

Just wanted to vent a little about something I’ve noticed at recent shows in DC — people seem to be forgetting basic concert etiquette: like STOP TALKING during the performances… 

I went to see James Vincent McMorrow at Union Stage last night, and while he was amazing, it was honestly hard to enjoy the show because of the crowd around me (My partner and I were one person away from the front stage, center).

There was this one couple singing along so loudly to the left side of the stage that it was almost like they were trying to outshine JVM. It wasn’t a light sing-along vibe; it was loud enough to be distracting. At one point, James gave side eye in the direction but, of course, that couple were too into singing to each other to notice. Then there were these two girls who talked non-stop through the opening act, which just felt disrespectful to Young Jesus. They also kept shouting out song titles to James to play. I felt embarrassed for them when James cracked at them that he played those songs already; like were they not “there” to hear it? Trick question: They were; just talking during the entire show.  And, to top it off, another couple near the front got into a heated argument, making everyone around them visibly uncomfortable.

I tried my best to enjoy JVM/Young Jesus and tune them out, but it was pretty frustrating, especially JVM is my partner’s ult band. It got to the point where I almost snapped and cursed those people out!

Concerts should be a space where we can all enjoy the music together, but last night was a reminder that some folks just seem to miss the memo on concert etiquette.

Hello, fellow Washingtonians! I want to make sure you all are aware of a major murder case in which the defendants are being considered for a presidential pardon. The timing is critical since most pardons happen right before an administration leaves office.

The case is commonly known as the ""8th and H"" case. Eight young men were given life sentences for the 1984 murder of Catherine Fuller, a crime they maintain they didn't commit.

Similar to the Central Park Five, the police coerced several false confessions. No physical evidence tied them to the crime scene. When the prosecutor found evidence that pointed to their innocence, he hid the information from the defense lawyers.

The six surviving men have applied for a presidential pardon with the help of the mid-Atlantic chapter of the Innocence Project.

I've investigated this case for the past 3.5 years and would happily answer any questions.

I work for a small nonprofit that holds an annual 3-day meeting of about 50 people. We've had a really hard time finding meeting space the past few years. I'm hoping this community has some non-traditional suggestions.

Large hotels have jacked up their food prices beyond what we can afford, and it seems like most of the smaller hotels have meeting rooms that max out at 50 (classroom setup...). When we've booked rooms at capacity, it's been uncomfortably tight.

Universities want you to be affiliated, and the private meeting spaces (e.g. Davinci Meeting Rooms) are even more expensive than hotels.

For reference - we used to be at Hall of States. We started to outgrow the space, and last year finally bit the bullet and moved. Last year we were at the Beacon Hotel. It was...not great. They weren't set up for conferences - the space was clearly designed for wedding receptions.

Ideally we'd find another space like Hall of States that's just a little bit larger than their rooms. Basically an in-house conference space that they also rent out to outside groups. They also allowed us to use outside catering, which is half the cost of hotel catering prices.

I stayed in Washington D.C. for 10 days at the end of October and had a great time, I loved your beautiful city! 

At the Jefferson Memorial I noticed something odd and I wanted to ask any history nerds here if you can explain it.

On the inside of the memorial, there are some inscriptions including an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence:

*""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men. We...solemnly publish and declare, that these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states...And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred* ***honour****.""*

Why is the word ""honour"" spelled in the British way rather than ""honor"" as it is in US English (and as it also appears in the final Declaration of Independence)?

ChatGPT tells me that the inscription spelling comes from a letter Jefferson wrote to George Washington Lewis and that, at the time, both spellings were used because the language had not yet been standardised.

Is that right?

I lived there recently in their two bedroom apartment at 767 Princeton Pl NW. The biggest issue is that the management is awful. They do NOT efficiently respond to requests for maintenance (and sometimes ignore them altogether). We had multiple instances where it took them months to fix issues. The biggest one was a LEAK in our living room ceiling. It started in May and it remained UNFIXED until we moved out in August. They brought in contractors on multiple occasions but they left the leak unfixed. We had to coordinate with the upstairs neighbors so they could stop using the restroom. 

When we first moved in in November, I noticed mold spores growing on the openings of the a/c units. When I alerted the owner, he took a look and tried to convince me that the mold was dirt! It wasn't until I sent a harsh email countering their claim that they decided to do something. And even then, they chose not to get us new a/c units until May of the next year! And it got quite hot in march. We even had to install the units ourselves.

The upstairs neighbors also had (and probably still have) mice living in their apartment. We never experienced any mice in our unit, but the air quality was horrendous. I would consistently wake up congested and lightheaded. It was only until we got our a/c units installed that the quality improved. Funnily enough, the tenant in the basement has a pest control business, worked for the landlord, and still was unable to keep the mice under control. I heard scurrying above our bathroom, and the downstairs tenant came to inspect it instead of the landlord. He decided nothing should be done about it.

I don't know if this is the best place to leave a review for this place, but I hope that this helps someone looking for an apt in the DC area.

Unfortunately, we're a tiny company with no budget for space rental, which I know is a big ask on a Saturday night. Usually we try to schedule our shows for earlier in the week when places are happy to have us perform and bring in a little extra bar business, but the timing of the shows on this tour means that this show has to be on that Saturday.

I've been cold emailing places begging to no avail. If anyone knows of any spaces that might be open to letting some nerds come in and shout some iambic pentameter for an hour and a half on a Saturday night, that would be so generous and we would be so grateful.

We don't need anything except an unlocked door and little open floor space. We don't use any tech (so no lights or sound) nor do we need a stage. Hell, if anyone has a decent-sized living room and wants to turn our show into a house party, we're happy to provide the entertainment.

We can provide references of other places we've performed at who can vouch for the fact that we were kind and respectful of their spaces.

I lack wisdom.

There is an ongoing pizza emergency. The size of the delivery bags on the delivery scooters are too small for large pizzas from our favorite establishments. I'm utilizing this bag as a baseline, because it's the ones I see all over town:

[https://transprous.squarespace.com/products/p/large-delivery-bag](https://transprous.squarespace.com/products/p/large-delivery-bag)

The dimensions are 17LX17W

I cold called the following pizza places as a spot check, or picked up a za:

* Andy's Pizza - The Box is 18X18, doesn't fit.
* Wise Guys Pizza - 18inch pizza, doesn't fit,
* We, the pizza - 3 different size boxes for 3 different pizzas, 14, 16 and 20. 20 definitely won't fit. 16 maybe? 14 yes.
* Pazollis - Same deal. Large won't fit. Medium might fit, small will fit.

I called the Transpro company. I told him his delivery bags are too small and was promptly met with ""Who is this?"" ""I'm just a guy who likes pizza"" ""What?"" ""Man, your bags are too small"" ""He said thanks boss and hung up.

This is how I feel right now: ""https://youtu.be/rYy0o-J0x20?si=eldD9fCL9nbnufB1&t=102""

This delivery bag situation puts pizza makers, delivery drivers and all of us in a nasty situation. Somehow, we got to get these guys wider bags. Until the bags are 4 inches wider, we lack the infrastructure for efficient pizza delivery in the nations capital.

Instead of taking them out to dinner, I hosted a Thanksgiving meal with 5 strangers in my apartment and it ended up being a [magical evening](https://imgur.com/a/VhSIC5t). 

I repeated this event [2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/yrnwyz/need_some_thanksgiving_cheer_ill_host_you_for/) and it was still a [ton of fun](https://imgur.com/a/qFQyOJ4). 

So let's do it again! The /u/Zwillium sometimes-annual Thanksgiving dinner is back on this year! 

If you're traveling/new to the city/lonely and don't have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving/decided you don't actually like your family, I'll **cook you a meal with all the fixings - Turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, desserts, drinks - the whole nine yards.

(**No one complained about the food last time, so it will still be made by the professionals at Whole Foods, but I'll warm it up and pretend I made the whole thing. Dietary restrictions can still be accommodated within reason.)

I can reasonably squeeze 14 folks into my apartment in Southwest, DC. If memory serves me right, everyone who wanted to join was able, so please don't be shy!

If you'd like to join, send me a message or reply here and I'll get you added to the list. 

WHEN: Thanksgiving Day, meal at 5 PM-ish

WHERE: Southwest DC, 2 minute walk from the Southwest Waterfront Metro (Green Line)

**UPDATES** 

EDIT 1 - 6 spots claimed so far! (will message you all shortly - about to head to the airport).

EDIT 2 (NOV 12) - We're at 14 tentative spots so far - please keep posting/messaging if you would like to join; last year I had a handful of cancellations, so I can probably still get you in! At this point I'll open up a ""waitlist"" that will be first-come, first-serve if/when others cancel.

EDIT 3 (NOV 12) - Everyone thus far who has expressed interest should have received a message/chat with a link to a google form so I can better gauge interest (I had a handful of last minute cancellations last time and want to see if I can better manage this year). It also gives you spots to enter food/drink preferences, allergies, and a couple other bits of info. Please message/chat me if I somehow missed you!

EDIT 4 (NOV 25) What a great turnout! I'm going to re-arrange the seating so we can squeeze in a few more folks. Anticipating somewhere in the vicinity of 18-20 folks. Very excited!

I'll be visiting DC for a week in December, and as someone who's never been to the US before, I'd really appreciate some guidance on tipping culture. I've read through several tourist info posts, but I'm hoping to get more specific details.

Would love your help with these following questions:

1. What are the standard tipping rates for restaurant and Uber rides? 

2. For card payments, is tipping done directly on the card machine? What's the typical process?

3. How cashless-friendly is DC? Can I rely mainly on my Visa card, or should I keep cash on hand?

4. Does paying by card involve much surcharge?

5. Is tipping expected at: 

* Supermarkets/convenience stores
* Takeout restaurants
* Airport shops
* Hotel Services (including hotel check-in, luggage handling, cleaning, luggage storage after checkout)



Is there any other tipping situations I should be aware of?

Thank you in advance for your help!

We're having trouble finding a place because we've been living abroad. My credit is good (though not great, above 700) and between the two of us we make over $200K. But our applications to rent have been denied by a few condos because we don't have the documentation they want. Basically, it's proof of income and prior rental agreements.

Our income has been in euros to foreign bank accounts, paid once per month rather than biweekly. So we don't have the US paycheck stubs they're asking for.

We've been renting in Helsinki for 5 years so we of course have old rental agreements but they're in Finnish and they're not being accepted here by any of the major property management companies. We could put them in touch with our previous landlords but they don't speak much English.

What do we do? Is there a way around this?

Laslty, let me finish by saying: this housing market is insane. I know the DA sued a few property management companies for price collusion. Good, I hope it wrecks these companies. They've basically formed a cartel and i shows, there are hundreds of empty condos across the city but no company will lower the price below \~$3,400 for a 900 sq ft 2 bedroom.

I moved to the area in 2017 for a summer internship initially which turned into a full time job, and even though I wanted to be in DC proper, my housing options were kinda limited due to a last minute move and short intended stay at the time. Luckily I found a cheap sublease at my current place and it all worked out. 

Since then. I’ve been living on the cheap with roommates to save up on housing costs, hoping to save for a down payment at some point. I’m not quite ready to pull the trigger on buying just yet, but in the meantime I do feel like it is time to upgrade my living situation so I'm on a hunt for a 1-br apartment. 

Given that I haven’t had to look for housing since I moved here, I’m finding it a little overwhelming to find the right place and hoping to get some recommendations for apartment complexes. From my research, it seems like all the new buildings are the ones that offer a lot of luxurious amenities, and while I'm pretty open to those if I can find a good deal, I don’t want to pay an arm and leg just for the extra amenities. The most important thing is to have a nice apartment with all the necessities such as in-unit washer/dryer, easy access to public transportation, natural light, and most importantly, good management. 

About me: mid-30s male, single, pretty good income, have a car and would want garage parking, work in downtown DC with in-office presence three days a week. Pretty flexible on the location and budget, but would like to keep it within $2500 all inclusive.

However, my career changes forced my plan to visit DC at a much later date, somewhere after 2027.

  
In 2017, when Trump was sworn in as president, my old friends living in the DC area notified me that throughout the entire 4 years, MAGA people, white supremacists, and people holding confederate flags roaming across the street became a regular instance. Things didn't end well when the January 6 insurrection happened.

  
I was scheduled to visit Washington, D.C., in 2028 with better financial and personal stability. With Trump returning to the White House in 2025 and expecting him to leave in 2029, my timing with the newly scheduled trip now came into question. Furthermore, Trump had a long history of stoking anti-Asian rhetoric during the pandemic and never apologized after the Atlanta spa shooting in 2021, which now came into question regarding my safety as an Asian American.

  
Will Washington D.C. be safe to travel as an Asian American during the Trump administration?

I'd love to move to a predominantly black or at least diverse neighborhood that is safe for the most part & has good walkability (though i do plan on driving as well), relatively close to restaurants/cafes & things to do. My budget is likely going to be about $1800 a month max comfortably. I've been looking at the following neighborhoods: 

* Hillcrest
* Edgewood
* Bloomingdale
* U Street
* Shaw
* Shepherd Park
* 16th Street Heights 
* originally was also interested in Anacostia, U Street Corridor, & Congress Heights but got conflicting reports on safety - thoughts?
* any others worth checking out that I'm missing?

Also would love to know what would be a good central area to stay in when visiting as I plan to make some trips down there in the next year & want to scope out some potential neighborhoods. 

I've been to DC twice and enjoyed it a lot every time I've been there so would love some recommendations of some must see spots.

\- There are also certain rules around storage of the gun -- whether in your home, vehicle, or elsewhere.

**WHAT?**

We are an informal meetup group gathering at bars around the District. All we want is to socialize after a long week and make new friends. All are welcome - whether you’re an old school Washingtonian, a recent transplant, or (gasp) not a Redditor, this group is for you!

**A SPECIAL NOTE:**

This happy hour is meant for people to gather and feel comfortable interacting with folk, both new and old. You can, and will, be asked forcefully to not return if you are being a massive dick or an active creep! Please let the host or guest host know if you feel uncomfortable or in danger from any participant, whether it's to the level where you want someone to be on the lookout to bail you out of a conversation if they approach you again or if you think they shouldn't be allowed to return.

Respect people's personal space always, as well as a no when it's given to you. And don't be a stereotypical Redditor when it comes to talking to women in particular--this is not a place to pick up a date.

Yes, measuring how big of a dick or a creep one is being may be a subjective thing, and similarly, yes, I do not care about that!

How do you feel that the election will impact the DC job market? 

Asking this question from a labor market analysis perspective. DC population is roughly 680K people- with around 21% of the employeed population working in federal services (according to BLS) so I would anticipate that historically elections impact labor market shifts here quite significantly. 


Some of my takes: 
- in politics: obviously with dems losing the senate and white house (and with the GOP maintaining the house), there will be fewer jobs working in politics for Dem staffers. 
- In private sector: As for private sector, I think the job market for consultants and gov contractors or politics adjacent jobs will shift as well. Curious as to which sectors will be impacted.
- For non political jobs, I imagine there will be less of a shift, but if people relocate to DC for political focused jobs I imagine a shift in other sectors as well.
