Mine would probably be that the buses are a lot better than people make them out to be, and that public transportation in general is quite good. Just wish it ran a bit later.

A buddy and I drove up from DC for a hiking weekend in West Virginia. We went to a diner for breakfast, and were seated next to a couple of hunters from Pennsylvania. We chatted a bit with the hunters about how their bow-hunting was going, and they seemed like nice guys. Then another hunter who was local from the WV town came and joined them. They jokingly told him, ""Hey, make sure and be polite, we've got some folks from DC over there."" I joked back, ""Yeah, we're the deep state!"" (I'm a federal worker and my friend is a contractor.) The guy frowned and said something hostile-sounding, like, ""People from Washington DC might not get treated very well here.""

I didn't really know what to say. I kind of shrugged and was like, ""Uh ... Everyone's been really nice so far?"" Then we just continued kind of being friendly and chatting off and on with the hunters in between talking with each other - they asked where we were staying and we told them about our Airbnb and how crazy the real estate prices seemed to be and so on. When it was time to pay, the waitress looked at us like we were the scum of the earth. I don't know, it just felt like a really weird vibe. I've been out to various West Virginia towns for weekend getaways probably five or six times, and nothing like that ever happened before. 

I was just curious whether anyone else has experienced something similar in the past - people seemingly mad at you just for being from DC, without knowing almost anything else about you?

Then, when I was driving back into DC, I followed a giant militant-looking black pickup truck with a big death's head skull/American flag logo on it through my peaceful, bucolic northwest DC neighborhood - you don't usually see that on our neighborhood streets, since a giant truck like that could never succeed at parallel parking in these parts, so it really stuck out. I see those kinds of trucks all the time on my frequent travels down south to visit family.

My name is Harold Christy. I am a US Army combat veteran; a DC homeowner, voter, and taxpayer; and a near-daily Metro rider. I am currently employed as an investigator with the D.C. Office of the Inspector General. Prior to that, I spent twenty-five years with the United States Secret Service.

I am writing because of an incident that occurred on a Green Line train on July 16, 2024. I was traveling home from work and had just boarded the train at Navy Yard. While I was standing by myself, minding my own business in my suit, holding a briefcase and reading a magazine, individuals aboard the train began to play extremely loud and obscene music while dancing and aggressively panhandling in the aisle‚Äîall in clear violation of WMATA regulations and D.C. law. Their actions deprived me and the other paying passengers of the peaceful enjoyment of this common conveyance, and restricted our movements, as the dancers' erratic motions effectively occupied the entire space. While these dance crews are a common occurrence on the New York City subway, they have only recently emerged on Metro, possibly because of the 'depolicing' that many DMV jurisdictions have been practicing.

It should be noted that subway dancing for money violates multiple DC criminal statutes, including 22-1321 (disorderly conduct), 22-2302 (a) and (b) (aggressive panhandling), 35-251 (unlawful conduct on public passenger vehicles), 22-2001 (false imprisonment), and 22-404 (assault).

Outraged by this behavior, I demanded that the dancers stop their criminal and dangerous activity. They ignored my objections and continued to dominate the space with their movements and violent music. When the train reached Waterfront, I attempted to push one of the individuals off the train, to stop the unlawful, harmful activity and because I was in apprehension of imminent offensive contact to me and the other passengers in the area. The other dancer grabbed me from behind and violently threw me toward the opposite door. When the door eventually opened, I succeeded in extricating myself from the car.

It should be noted that I never let go of my briefcase, because it contained my official OIG laptop. Therefore, everything I did that day, I did one-handed.

After their violent acts against me, the dancers, as shown in WMATA surveillance video, continued to perform between Waterfront and L'Enfant Plaza, ceasing their performance just before arriving at the latter stop so they could walk the aisles and solicit funds from the passengers who had just watched them throw a grown man off the train.

According to an affidavit by an MTPD detective, these individuals who were engaged in obviously illegal activity then had the audacity to complain to WMATA Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD). Officers responded, interviewed at least one dancer and witness, and, even though the dancer admitted to violating the above criminal statutes while relating his version of events, MTPD did not arrest or even ticket the dancer. Rather, MTPD conducted a high-tech investigation, analyzing train-car and station video to determine my movements and pulling Metrocard records to identify me and place an alert in the turnstile system. In other words, they started a 21st-centruy manhunt for a man in a suit with a briefcase. For defending himself and others.

My next commute home from work, paying with my Metrocard again in spite of the packs of idlers who still jump even the new, higher turnstiles, I was met by three MTPD officers who had staked out the Navy Yard station based on my predictable pattern of life (most people with jobs and homes have a predictable pattern of life. This is why it is easier to investigate and prosecute law-abiding citizens than street criminals). They conducted a field interrogation of me, in front of the other commuters, and sent me on my way.

Several weeks later, I was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor assault and spent a day in leg irons, a belly band, and handcuffs while waiting for my arraignment in Superior Court. For defending myself and others.

The United States Attorney‚Äôs Office for the District of Columbia is now prosecuting me for this misdemeanor criminal offense. Under DC law, because the maximum sentence is 180 days, I am not even entitled to a jury of my peers, but rather the sterile legal analysis of a judge. For defending myself and others.

It appears that, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, WMATA and MTPD are content to see ""all the laws but one to go unexecuted."" I am glad to see that MTPD seems to be getting away from the days of depolicing. However, selectively prosecuting a paying passenger for reacting to rampant, unsafe, unlawful conduct is the wrong way to start this process. It places your ridership on notice that our role is to pay our fares, sit down and shut up, while the few malefactors among us make the stations and cars a horror show of unlawful and hazardous conduct.

No wonder every lawyer I have spoken to in my Superior Court odyssey has admitted to never riding Metro.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that you will do something to improve matters.

She transferred the funds into a Chase bank account. According to her, they marked the transfer as suspicious and froze the account. A month later, they terminated her account and she wasn't able to get the funds back. 

  
I advised her to file a claim with the FDIC in the beginning of November. The month beforehand, she told me (did not make a notarized contract) that she would create a contract to reimburse us. After ghosting me for days on end when I would ask her for proof of her notarization or FDIC claim, she told me that her order would come Friday. Last minute, she also claimed that me and my roommates would only receive 250 back. If any of us attempted to file with small claims, she also said she would counterclaim for more than $2500 (the overall amount of the security deposit). 

  
Although she failed to provide an itemized set of damages, she claimed that the money would be withheld for a myriad of reasons, including the following: 

\- The emotional damages of not informing her that my cat was pregnant. (I didn't know and she was the first person I informed). According to her, this brought her emotional distress because it triggered her PTSD with an abortion 

\- Forcing her to clean the house and leaving it in ""unsanitary conditions."" She argued that I was neglecting my cat and overfed her constantly, which led her to complaining about the litter box because her feces were huge. She also left a pile of dishes in the sink, which grew mold as people waited for her to come back. 

 \- Smoking in the house (I never smoked in the house and she doesn't even know who was. She also has a medical card). 

\- Being ""violently confronted"" by one of my roommates (although this reaction was warranted and there was no proof of physical damage). I have generalized anxiety disorder, just like her, and loud noises are one of my triggers

The money that I used for my security deposit is scholarship money. I signed a contract that legally stated that the money can only be used for individual purposes (tuition, rent, transportation, etc). Her claiming this money is not only a violation of tenant rule, it is also a violation that can get me in trouble and put me in a situation of academic jeopardy.

Hello, fellow Washingtonians! I want to make sure you all are aware of a major murder case in which the defendants are being considered for a presidential pardon. The timing is critical since most pardons happen right before an administration leaves office.

The case is commonly known as the ""8th and H"" case. Eight young men were given life sentences for the 1984 murder of Catherine Fuller, a crime they maintain they didn't commit.

Similar to the Central Park Five, the police coerced several false confessions. No physical evidence tied them to the crime scene. When the prosecutor found evidence that pointed to their innocence, he hid the information from the defense lawyers.

The six surviving men have applied for a presidential pardon with the help of the mid-Atlantic chapter of the Innocence Project.

I've investigated this case for the past 3.5 years and would happily answer any questions.

We can provide references of other places we've performed at who can vouch for the fact that we were kind and respectful of their spaces.

However, my career changes forced my plan to visit DC at a much later date, somewhere after 2027.

  
In 2017, when Trump was sworn in as president, my old friends living in the DC area notified me that throughout the entire 4 years, MAGA people, white supremacists, and people holding confederate flags roaming across the street became a regular instance.

With Trump returning to the White House in 2025 and expecting him to leave in 2029, my timing with the newly scheduled trip now came into question. Furthermore, Trump had a long history of stoking anti-Asian rhetoric during the pandemic and never apologized after the Atlanta spa shooting in 2021, which now came into question regarding my safety as an Asian American.

  
Will Washington D.C. be safe to travel as an Asian American during the Trump administration?
