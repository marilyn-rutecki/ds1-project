USA: WASHINGTON: COMBAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN RALLY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbHHfqfJwho,3,291,1,"(9 Apr 1995) English/Nat

The sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, the murdered ex-wife of O-J Simpson, joined  thousands of protestors in Washington D-C today (Sunday) in a rally to combat violence  against women.

Denise Brown and celebrities including actors Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly  supporting  a broad coalition of groups fighting for a variety of women's rights.

The rally, organised by the National Organisation for Women, encompassed a variety of  issues - from violence against abortion clinics, to gay and lesbian and victims' rights.

It was a symbol of what these protestors see as the epidemic of violence against  women - the National Organisation for Women say it spreads from abortion clinic  attacks to politics.

More than six-thousand tee shirts were displayed on Washington D-C's National Mall,  each representing a story of abuse, rape or other form of violence.

Some messages were so strong that many were overcome with emotion.

The tee shirts were part of the Clothesline Project, which aims to draw attention to the  growing problem of violence faced by women today.

The white shirts were some of the most poignant as they represent women who  ultimately died after suffering years of abuse.

Some of those who made it here said the shirts mean they have survived and hope to  draw attention to society's violence against women.

SOUNDBITE:
""They say that we are survivors. And we are strong. And we are here, we're surviving."" 
SUPER CAPTION: Jane

One woman hanging a white shirt had her own tale of domestic abuse to tell.

Denise Brown, sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, displayed a shirt with messages written  by the children of her dead sister and O-J Simpson.  

SOUNDBITE:
""Each of the children. They wrote their own little sayings here. Here's from Sidney. 'I  miss you so much, love Sidney'.""
SUPER CAPTION: Denise Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's Sister

By the middle of the day, thousands had gathered to make sure their message was  heard.

One target of their protest was Newt Gingrich, the Republican House Speaker, who is  threatening to cut social programs designed to help women.

One of the rally's organisers, Eleanor Smeal, says the Republican's Contract with  America does nothing for women.

SOUNDBITE:
""And they can't take this majority they want in fiscal conservatism and now create more  violence towards women by cutting the social programs and by, frankly, cutting back  women's rights.""
SUPER CAPTION: Eleanor Smeal, President, Fund for the Feminist Majority

Hollywood celebrities, like Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless, were also on hand to vent their  frustration at Congress for what they say is its lack of concern for women's issues.

SOUNDBITE:
""I think that at the end of the hundred days, ah, there's nothing for women. And so I  think what it's done in reverse form is, yeah, gotten people angry. And we're all here."" 
SUPER CAPTION: Sharon Gless, Actor 

While thousands hope their message is heard on Capitol Hill, perhaps it is these quiet  reminders that are blowing in the breeze which could make the strongest impression.

"Gender-Based Violence: It’s Really, Really Not Your Fault | Lauren Taylor | TEDxBethesdaWomen",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYhpFpOs1ts,12,460,1,"“Gender-Based Violence: It’s Not Your Fault, and It’s Also Not Your Fault” implores us to be aware, to be true to ourselves and to embrace self-compassion – rather than being “nice” or “amiable” as our go-to response or way of being. Lauren R. Taylor has been working to end gender-based violence since 1978, when she co-founded Washington, D.C.’s, first shelter for abused women and their children. She’s a survivor who, for more than 35 years, has been teaching skills for stopping harassment, abuse, and assault to those most often targeted: women, LGBTQIA+ people, teens, children, and disabled people. 

As a trainer and director of Defend Yourself, Lauren and her team have reached more than 40,000 people in the D.C. area and nationally. Her writing on interpersonal violence and violence prevention has been widely published in The Washington Post, Everyday Feminism, the Ms. Blog, and other media. Lauren recently co-authored"" Get Empowered: A Practical Guide to Thrive, Heal, and Embrace Your Confidence in a Sexist World.""
