Washington&#39;s &#39;crime has exploded&#39; have the Democrats ruined the US capital?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-iZi1JFIRY,655,35537,308,"When thinking of Washington DC, grand monuments and museums might come to mind, however, in recent years, America's capital has become more renowned for its growing homeless population and rising crime.

“Crime here has exploded, people do not feel safe,” Isaac Smith, an Emergency Medical Technician in DC, told The Telegraph for a documentary film about the capital.

“I have a bullet hole through my living room,” Mr Smith continued.

“I hear gunshots frequently and I live right next to an elementary school. There’s a bullet hole in one of the [school’s] windows.”

Violent crime in DC has risen by 10% since 2022, which includes a 15% increase in homicides.

Mr Smith blames the Democrats, who have dominated the city’s local politics for decades, for the rise in violence.

“At the end of the day, they don't believe that people have agency. They don't believe that people have free will. So people do not act, they are acted upon.”

Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of the city, will be hosting a Public Safety Summit on Wednesday to engage with locals on how to tackle the increase in crime.

----------------------------------------­----------------------------------------­----------------

Police have released new evidence in the quadruple homicide case of the Savopoulos family murder in Washington, DC, including a bloody baseball bat that was found in the same room as the three adult victims.

Savvas Savopoulos, 46, the wealthy CEO of American Iron Works, along with his wife, Amy, 47, and their 10-year-old son Philip were killed and their home was set on fire on May 14. The family's housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, 57, was also found injured and given CPR before she died at a local hospital.

The only suspect in the case, Daron Dylon Wint, 34, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder. Wint’s DNA was found on a pizza crust at the scene of the crime, and one of the victim’s blood as found on his shoe. Although he is currently the only suspect, police believe he didn’t act alone.

Other evidence in the case includes video evidence of a suspect fleeing after setting the victim’s stolen car on fire. Initially police said there were no signs of forced entry at the house, but a broken side door window and bootprint were submitted later as evidence in the case.

Police have released new evidence in the quadruple homicide case of the Savopoulos family murder in Washington, DC, including a bloody baseball bat that was found in the same room as the three adult victims.

Savvas Savopoulos, 46, the wealthy CEO of American Iron Works, along with his wife, Amy, 47, and their 10-year-old son Philip were killed and their home was set on fire on May 14. The family's housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, 57, was also found injured and given CPR before she died at a local hospital.

The only suspect in the case, Daron Dylon Wint, 34, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder. Wint’s DNA was found on a pizza crust at the scene of the crime, and one of the victim’s blood as found on his shoe. Although he is currently the only suspect, police believe he didn’t act alone.

Other evidence in the case includes video evidence of a suspect fleeing after setting the victim’s stolen car on fire. Initially police said there were no signs of forced entry at the house, but a broken side door window and bootprint were submitted later as evidence in the case.

D.C. hospital homicide: patient killed after struggle with hospital guards - TomoNews,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzjUkQDsQe8,36,3795,8,"WASHINGTON — A patient who was killed after a struggle with security guards at a Washington, D.C. hospital last year has been ruled a homicide.

The incident occurred after 74-year-old James E. McBride left the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Sept. 29 without having been formally discharged, the Washington Post reported.

McBride was spotted by a nurse and a security guard not far from the hospital. They walked him back to the hospital grounds, where he was turned over to two other security guards.

According to a police report cited by the Washington Post, McBride became ""non-compliant,"" and a struggle ensued. Two guards forced McBride to the ground while a third ""utilized hand controls to restrain"" him. He died two days after the incident.

The D.C. medical examiner's office ruled on Monday that McBride's cause of death was ""blunt force injuries"" of the neck with ""cervical spinal cord transection"" and ""vertebral artery compression,"" the Washington Post reported.

The security guards involved in the incident are special police officers licensed through the Washington, D.C. police. Two of the guards had previously been put on administrative leave, the Washington Post reported.

The suspect in a quadruple homicide at an upscale Washington D.C. mansion last week was arrested Thursday evening after a multi-state manhunt took place.

Daron Dylon Wint, 34, was identified by police Wednesday and is suspected to have killed Savvas Savopoulos, his wife, 10-year old son and housekeeper on May 14 before attempting to burn down their mansion. 

Although the search for Wint stretched up to New York City, he was arrested in northeast D.C. after being tailed by police. They ID'd him using pizza crust found at the mansion.

According to sources who spoke with ABC, Wint's DNA was found on the crust of a Domino's pizza from inside the house. The pizza was delivered to the home while Wint allegedly had the Savopoulos family and their housekeeper tied up. 

The Washington Post reported Savopoulos made numerous phone calls shortly before the house caught fire, including a call to his assistant, a bank and an accountant. His assistant also dropped off $40,000 to the house.

D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser called the quadruple homicide an ""act of evil"" during a Thursday press conference once Wint had been identified.

So far there hasn't been a motive attached to the murders. According to law enforcement, Wint had worked for the company owned by Savopoulos in the past.

DC Snipers&#39; Chevy Caprice - A look inside the sniper murder car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAc4TtWwbw,474,75591,96,"20 years ago, the Beltway/DC Snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the  District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for three weeks in a series of coordinated attacks. Ten people were killed at the hand of the DC snipers and three were critically wounded. The ATF produced this video to demonstrate how detectives believed the sniper suspects used a Chevrolet Caprice as a killing machine.

Malvo was a juvenile when he and Muhammad embarked on the killing spree in the DMV. Others were killed as the pair made their way to the D.C. region from Washington state. Muhammad was executed in 2009.

On Feb. 8, oral arguments began in Malvo's quest to seek either sentencing relief or release under a Maryland law that applies to prisoners who were convicted as juveniles.

About Mark of a Serial Killer:
Some killers are collectors who obtain perverse gratification by habitually stealing mementos from murder scenes, from jewelry to shoes, keys to even body parts. These clues are left to taunt law enforcement and investigators while simultaneously building up their notoriety. Whether it’s text scrawled onto the victim’s body, a cryptic note or a way of positioning the deceased, what is left behind is a trademark clue that ultimately aids the investigation in stopping these murders and bringing the killer to justice.

About Oxygen:

Having announced the full-time shift to crime programming in 2017, Oxygen has become the fastest growing cable entertainment network with popular unscripted original programming that includes the flagship “Snapped” franchise, “The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway,” “The Jury Speaks,” “Cold Justice,” “Three Days to Live,” and “It Takes A Killer.” Available in more than 77 million homes, Oxygen is a program service of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment, a division of NBCUniversal, one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies in the development, production, and marketing of entertainment, news, and information to a global audience.

"Teen Killed, Officer and 2 Adults Injured in DC Shooting: Police",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iL5BXPYoG4,436,31006,90,"A 15-year-old boy was shot to death and three adults, including a police officer, were wounded after a musical event lacking a permit erupted into chaos in Washington DC on Sunday night, police said.

The wounded police officer and the other adults were recovering at hospitals, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III told reporters at the scene of the shooting.

The incident took place near 14th and U Streets NW, about 2 miles north of the White House in the US capital.

Social media had promoted a free music event known as Moechella and several hundred people were gathering in the area around 6 pm, Contee said.

Police arrived to assist the crowd and people stayed mostly to the sidewalks as music played from a truck, he said.

In the hours that followed a fight broke out, and then an incident of an undetermined nature caused people to scatter, Contee said.

Police shut down the gathering, he said, because the event appeared to have become unsafe.

Several people were hurt in the rush to leave the area and were being assisted by public safety first responders when the shooting occurred, Contee said.

He said the events occurred between 6 and 8:30 pm.

A handgun was recovered from one of the victims but not the firearm believed to have caused the death and injuries, Contee said.

No police fired their weapons and there was no exchange of gunfire, he said.

The police chief said officials would be speaking to event organizers and considering what legal action could be taken because the event lacked a permit.

“We will certainly want to make sure that people are held accountable when they hold unpermitted events in our city,” he said.

Car thief ringleader sentenced to 25 years in prison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huNPBgCKMaU,5119,791422,2986,"Montgomery County Judge Sharon Burrell just sentenced Markus Kemp, 23, of D.C. to 25 years in prison.  

""I don't think we've ever had a case that involved car thefts, only car thefts, where there was not violence, that got this kind of sentence, 25 years. It was richly deserved,"" said Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy.

Kemp pleaded guilty to five counts of auto theft, conspiracy, theft over $25,000, and burglary. Prosecutors said he recruited friends and pilfered high-end cars in the suburbs and then rented them out in D.C. for prices up to $1,000 a day.

Kemp was a particularly bold and brazen thief, recruiting buddies from his D.C. neighborhood to case the wealthy, quiet streets of Chevy Chase and Bethesda in the midst of the pandemic lockdown and often in broad daylight, looking for only the most expensive cars, prosecutors said.

He struck at least 13 times between January and July 2020 and made off with more than $450,000 worth of Audis, Teslas and other vehicles.

At one point, he posted on Instagram with a Model X with a base price of $120,990.

""Until it happens to you, you can't believe it..... You're violated, you're violated. Your sense of peace is gone,"" said Paulo Costa, a neighbor of one of the victims.

""This is not the first time the defendant was involved in orchestrating motor vehicle thefts. In 2019, as an adult, the defendant was charged for four separate incidents involving theft, motor vehicle theft, and rogue and vagabond in Chevy Chase, MD. As a result, the defendant was placed on probation in January 2020 (C.R. #135619C) after being convicted of motor vehicle theft as an adult. Only a few weeks after being placed on probation, the defendant violated his probation by engaging in these additional motor vehicle thefts and burglaries."" according to a sentencing memo from the State's Attorney's Office. 

Prosecutor McCarthy said Kemp was a sort of criminal entrepreneur. 

""He would take these high-end cars, take them into D.C., and then he started his own rental business... Each car, $200 to $500 a day. He bragged about the fact that he got $1,000 one day for a single car rental,"" he said.

McCarthy praised the dedicated Montgomery County Police auto theft squad, which broke the case, but has since been disbanded.

One guy who had his Tesla stolen tracked it into D.C. with his phone. When he got to that location and saw no one around, he jumped in his car, started it with his phone, and drove it home, McCarthy said.

0:00 Introduction
2:25 ALL LAWS PASSED BY THE D.C. LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST UNDERGO A 30-DAY REVIEW PERIOD BY CONGRESS BEFORE THEY CAN TAKE EFFECT. DURING THIS TIME, CONGRESS CAN BLOCK THE LEGISLATION.
3:06 17% OF D.C. RESIDENTS LIVE IN POVERTY (30% BLACK PEOPLE) - ACCORDING TO CENSUS BUREAU DATA
3:13 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN PERPETUATING SEGREGATION IN WASHINGTON D.C.
3:17 FOR EXAMPLE THE HOME OWNERS' LOAN CORPORATION (HOLC) WAS A FEDERAL AGENCY THAT WAS CREATED IN 1933 TO HELP HOMEOWNERS REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
3:45 REDLINING WAS A PRACTICE BY WHICH BANKS AND OTHER LENDING INSTITUTIONS DREW LINES AROUND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE HIGH-RISK FOR LENDING.
4:03 BLOCKBUSTING WAS A PRACTICE BY WHICH REAL ESTATE AGENTS WOULD INTRODUCE A SINGLE AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY INTO A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.
4:10 THE REAL ESTATE AGENTS WOULD THEN USE SCARE TACTICS TO CONVINCE NEIGHBORING WHITE HOMEOWNERS TO SELL THEIR HOMES AT A LOSS.
4:27 THESE PRACTICES WERE EVENTUALLY OUTLAWED, BUT THEY HEAVILY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POVERTY IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THEY MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO GET GOOD JOBS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL.
5:28 THE LAW INCREASED THE PENALTIES FOR DRUG OFFENSES, PARTICULARLY FOR CRACK COCAINE OFFENSES, WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUG POSSESSION AND DISTRIBUTION.
6:14 FEDERAL COURTS USE DIFFERENT RULES OF EVIDENCE THAN STATE COURTS. THIS CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DEFENDANTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST FEDERAL JUDGES.
6:22 FEDERAL CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY MORE COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING THAN STATE CRIMINAL TRIALS. THIS CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DEFENDANTS TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL PROCESS.
7:37 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR 2. POLICY ANALYST 3. CITY MANAGER 4. BUDGET ANALYST 5. URBAN PLANNER 6. NONPROFIT MANAGER 7. HUMAN RESOURCES SPECIALIST 8. PUBLIC RELATIONS SPECIALIST 9. GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR 10. PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATOR
8:11 THE HIGHEST CRIME IN AMERICA IS IN WASHINGTON D.C.
8:15 THE BOTTOM 5% UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE U.S. IS WASHINGTON D.C.
8:18 THE BOTTOM 5% IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES IS IN WASHINGTON D.C.
8:58 THE GUN CONTROL ACT PROHIBITS THE POSSESSION OF HANDGUNS IN DC, EXCEPT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL PERMITS. (ROBBERIES SPIKES)
9:16 THE SUPREME COURT RULES OVERTURNS THE DISTRICT'S BAN ON HANDGUNS IN THE HOME. (ROBBERIES DECLINE)
10:46 HOUSING, FOOD, AND ENERGY. THOSE ARE THE 3 THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO SURVIVE. IF THOSE 3 THINGS BECAME CHEAP ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TO AFFORD THE VAST MAJORITY OF STREET LEVEL CRIME WOULD BE ERADICATED.",2023-06-26T13:00:41Z,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ,Valuetainment

Former DC drug kingpin now out of prison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV9SrRWajF8,3489,462002,685,"Tony Lewis, Sr. went to jail on drug charges in his late 20s. He was supposed to spend the rest of his life in a jail cell, never getting a taste of freedom again. In March, his life took another dramatic turn.

On April 15, 1989, more than two dozen people  were rounded up in D.C., accused of running a massive crack cocaine operation in the region, including Lewis, Sr. That day in 1989 was his last day as a free man — until now — 34 years later.

Tony and his son, Tony Lewis, Jr., spoke with WUSA9 about regaining his freedom. It's a moment the father and son have been dreaming of for decades, even with the elder Lewis' sentence.

He was sentenced to life without parole. 

""It's a slow death sentence, actually. That's what life without parole in the federal prison system is. They don't want to use those terms, but it's a slow death,"" Leiws, Sr. said. 

Lewis, Sr. was 26 at the time. His son was only 8 years old. 

""My mother sat me down and said, 'You need to write him. He needs you. He needs you now.' The backdrop to that, my father was a very present, doting father,"" Lewis, Jr. said. 

The bond between father and son was unbreakable, despite barriers. Lewis, Sr. was worried about his son's safety — navigating life in D.C. during the seemingly inescapable crack crisis, and poverty, but also because his former partner, drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III became a federal informant.

Lewis, Sr. said he hasn't kept tabs on Edmond.

""We were in touch somewhat, until he became an informant for the government and that was it with that,"" Lewis, Sr. said. ""I was somewhat surprised with that occurring.""

Still, Lewis, Sr. said all he could think about was protecting his son. 

""I think his greatest fear was me joining him. He never wavered from, 'This was essentially hell and I would never want you to come here and these are the steps that you have to take to not come here,'"" Lewis, Jr. said.

Instead, the younger Lewis focused on getting his father back home. He organized multiple rallies and a Free Tony Lewis campaign that went on for years. His argument was his father's sentence was unfair and excessive for a violent offender. 

""I broke the law. I understand that. I should have gone to prison, but not for the rest of my life for a non-violent drug offense,"" Lewis, Sr. said. ""I sincerely apologize to D.C. residents and I thank them for forgiving me.""

He was ultimately freed because of a policy established during the Trump administration focused on fair sentences, rehabilitation and second chances.

Lewis, Jr. delivered the news to his dad, still hoping it wasn't a dream. 

""I send him an email that said, 'Big boy, I'm coming to get you on Monday.' He hit me back like, 'Are you projecting?'""

Since then, it's been more than a week of reuniting with his family, grandkids, friends and his community. 

""We're nine days into this and in the morning, he's going with me to take my kids to school and I'm like, 'Is this dude really in the car with me,"" Lewis, Jr. said. 

""I think the same thing. I look back at the girls and I'm like one of my dreams is coming true,"" Lewis, Sr. said. 

He said he is ready to get to work for his community, he has a job lined up, and he's also hoping to amplify his story to keep others from going down the wrong path. As he put it, his jail cell is empty and he wants to keep it that way.

Reign of Terror | DC Snipers 20 years on,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfaS96hGV38,813,21175,65,"Innocent people murdered in broad daylight, picked out at random across Maryland, Washington DC and Virginia in in the notorious and fascinating Washington DC Beltway Sniper case from October 2002. 

No motive. No witnesses. No suspects. 

The snipers were literally getting away with murder. Everyone looked to the police for answers, but how would they even begin to solve a crime like this? We revist the case using 3D crime scene reconstructions and archive footage. 

We look at how serial killers Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammad evaded police so successfully, leaving thousands of people terrified to leave their homes, go to the store, fill up their cars with gas or take their children to school. 

Disclaimer: Locations and events have been reconstructed to the best of our ability. This is ultimately our interpretation and may not be entirely true to life.

"Final testimony: Florida woman zipped boyfriend in suitcase, left for dead",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2giKTBXmIXs,12,725,7,"Sarah Boone, a Florida woman, has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, Jr. Torres was found dead inside a suitcase in the couple's Winter Park apartment in February 2020. Boone claimed the two were playing a drunken game of hide-and-seek, but prosecutors argued that the video evidence and her own statements to police contradicted her claim of self-defense. Torres' sister Victoria called for Boone to ""rot in jail"" and expressed the triggering effect of using a suitcase.

Biggest Cases of the 80s | TRIPLE EPISODE | FBI Files,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyMen2PgjRA,435,43409,23,"00:00 - S2E12
In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named “Safebet,” that was designed to expose the Chicago Mafia’s infiltration into the city’s surrounding suburbs. Undercover agents quickly discovered that the mob had its tentacles spread into every facet of the law enforcement community.  Agents refocused and sought to expose the corrupt politicians and police.  They unwittingly uncovered the murder of a wealthy socialite perpetrated by a jealous and greedy mob lawyer and covered up by the local police chief.  The conspiracy gave the FBI the leverage they needed to break up the mob’s stranglehold in the suburbs.  

52:00 - S2E15
On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.  The FBI placed Franklin on their Ten Most Wanted list, and an intense manhunt began.  The white supremacist killer, responsible for as many as 20 murders, was arrested two months later by FBI agents in Tampa, Florida.

01:40:00 - S2E18
Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.  Using the profile, agents determined a seemingly unrelated event in Georgia was also the work of the .22 caliber killer.  The profile matched the suspect on every point.  It was enough to put the killer away for life.

Unravel the mystery alongside the FBI's greatest law enforcers and forensic scientists.

DC Snipers&#39; Chevy Caprice - A look inside the sniper murder car,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwAc4TtWwbw,474,75592,96,"20 years ago, the Beltway/DC Snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo terrorized the  District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia for three weeks in a series of coordinated attacks. Ten people were killed at the hand of the DC snipers and three were critically wounded. The ATF produced this video to demonstrate how detectives believed the sniper suspects used a Chevrolet Caprice as a killing machine.

Malvo was a juvenile when he and Muhammad embarked on the killing spree in the DMV. Others were killed as the pair made their way to the D.C. region from Washington state. Muhammad was executed in 2009.

On Feb. 8, oral arguments began in Malvo's quest to seek either sentencing relief or release under a Maryland law that applies to prisoners who were convicted as juveniles.

Police investigating an arson and quadruple homicide in an upscale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. on Thursday have now said they believe the four victims were held captive for a day before their house was burned down with them inside. Evidence also shows that there is more than one suspect in the case.

According to a report by local NBC affiliate WRC-TV, firefighters discovered the victims while putting out the fire. The homeowner, 46-year-old Savvas Savopoulos, his wife, their 10-year-old son, and one of their housekeepers were found tied up inside the burning house.

Another housekeeper told authorities that she received a voicemail from Savopoulos on Wednesday night, followed by a text message on Thursday telling her not to come to the house that day.

The family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911 was reportedly seen being driven away from the house at around 10:30 a.m. on the day of the arson. Police found the car at 5 p.m. after it had been set on fire in the parking lot of St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in Lanham, Maryland.

Footage of one of the suspects was captured by a surveillance camera at the church. Police are asking anyone with more information to contact them.

Inside A Crack House: US Drug Gangs Exposed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EGK4gGtz44,50939,7683277,9204,"Inside A Crack House: US Drug Gangs Exposed (True Crime Documentary) | Real Stories

In the summer of 2005, federal agents and police in Rockford, Illinois, captured over a thousand hours of surveillance footage inside a crack house. The gang smokes marijuana, plays with guns, and sells crack and heroin for six weeks, completely unaware that their every move is being recorded.

Customers come and go, unaware that their private lives are being revealed. This is an intimate portrait of a crack house's rise and fall, as well as a drug-addled American urban culture. Interviews with gang members, their friends, and police disclose the unavoidable tragedy - and the occasional dark humour - of a reality that exists underneath the surface of any major community.

Kan Çiçekleri 403. Bölüm Tanıtımı

 Baran ve Dilan beş yıl önce bir kaza geçirirler. Arabaları denize uçar. Bu kazada Baran ve Dilan kurtulur fakat Miran’ın cesedine ulaşamazlar. Dilan oğlunun ölümünü asla kabullenemez ve beş yıl boyunca köşe bucak oğlunu arar. Baran ise oğlunun ayakkabısı denizden çıkınca umudunu yitirir ve oğlunun ölümünü kabullenir. Baran ve Dilan bu konuda anlaşamaz bu acı ikisinin arasında büyük bir soruna dönüşür. Karı koca bu acının üstesinden gelemez Dilan konağı terk eder. Baran ise elini eteğini çekip kendisini kulübeye kapatır. 

 Baran bu süre zarfında gizli gizli Dilan’ı takip eder. Bir gün Dilan’ın Mardin’e gittiğini ve insan kaçakçılarının eline düştüğünü öğrenir. Baran, Dilan’ı kurtarır ve onu konağa geri getirir. Dilan ise Miran’ın yaşadığına dair bir bilgi elde etmiştir

 Baran ve Dilan konağa döndüğünde Hasan’ın eski eşi ve çocuklarıyla karşılaşırlar. Baran ve Dilan elde ettiği bilginin peşine düşmeye başlayınca Hasan’ın eski karısı Hacer ve oğlu Tarık tutuşur. 

 Beş yıl önce araba kazasının arkasında zira Hasan ve Tarık vardır. Bu kazada Miran’ın ölmesine izin vermemiş olan Tarık, Miran’ı oğlu gibi büyütür. Hacer ve Tarık çevirdikleri entrika ile Baran ve Dilan’ı oğullarının öldüğüne inandırır. Yıllar sonra Miran’ın mezarı bulunur. Dilan ve Baran çocuklarının yasını tutarken evde Tarık’ın oğlu olarak bildikleri Çınar ikisinin sevgisini kazanır. Dilan ve Baran Çınar’ı koruyup kollamaya başlarlar. Ona bağlanmaya başlarlar. 

 Baran ve Dilan Çınar ile yakınlaştıkça aile diken üstündedir. Tarık ise zamanla elde ettiği her şeyi bir bir kaybetmeye başlayacak bu savaş iyice kızışacak… Zamanla Çınar ile ilgili şüpheler doğacak ve Çınar’ın gerçek ailesinin peşine düşmeye başlayacaklar. Dilan ve Baran bu süreçte birçok olay yaşayacak… Miran’ın aslında Çınar olduğunu öğrenebilecekler mi?

 Kanla yoğurulan evlilikleri gerçek bir aşka dönüşen Dilan ve Baran’ın heyecan dolusu öyküsü Kan Çiçekleri ile hafta içi her gün 14:50’de Kanal 7 ekranlarında…

BÖLÜMÜN ÖZETİ

Alya, Cihan’ın sunduğu evlilik şartını reddeder. Bunun üzerine Cihan Albora
şikayetini geri çekmez ve Alya yargılanmak üzere mahkemeye sevk edilir.
Alya’nın, Cihan’ın evlilik şartını kabul etmediğini öğrenen Sadakat, son kozunu oynar
ama bu durum Alya’yı yumuşatmak yerine daha da sinirlendirir. Alya’nın yargılandığını bilen
Demir bu durumu fırsat bilerek Alya’yı kendisiyle iş birliği yapmaya ikna etmeye çalışır.
Alya, Demir’in teklifini kabul edecek ve Alboralar'ın düşmanı Baybarslarla iş birliği yapacak
mıdır?

Diğer taraftan Ecmel, Cihan’ı devirip oğlu Şahin’i Alboralar'ın başına geçirmek adına
türlü planlar yapmaya devam etmektedir. Cihan’ın tüm ticaret yollarını kapatmış, firmaları
tehdit ederek geri çekilmelerini sağlamıştır. Cihan, işlerine engel olan kişinin amcası Ecmel
Albora ve arkasındaki gücün ne olduğunu öğrenebilecek midir?

Alya, evlenme teklifini kabul ederek oğluna kavuşacak mıdır? Yoksa cezaevine
girecek ve oğlu Cihan Deniz’e veda mı edecektir?

DİZİNİN KONUSU 

Alya Albora, vefat eden eşinin vasiyetini yerine getirmek için cenazesi ve beş yaşındaki oğluyla Kanada’dan Mardin’deki Albora topraklarına gelir. Ancak bu gelişin bir dönüşü ve Albora’dan çıkışı yoktur. Albora aşiretinin başı Cihan Albora, Alya’nın çırpınışlarına kayıtsız kalmasa da çocuğunu alıp gitmesine izin vermez. Geçmişin karanlığı, saklanan sırlar ve bölgenin gerçeği ile yüzleşen Alya Albora, kendini kocasının ailesiyle büyük bir mücadele içinde bulur.

Los vecinos escucharon sus desesperados llamados y pidieron ayuda a un grupo de rescate animal. Al llegar, el equipo descubrió que la tapa del desagüe estaba sellada con cemento, pero no se rindieron. Inspeccionaron otra entrada y, con gran esfuerzo, lograron bajar al lugar donde estaba el gatito. Aunque aterrorizado, el pequeño fue rescatado gracias al ingenio y valentía del equipo. ¡Un rescate lleno de emociones y esperanza! Dale me gusta y suscríbete para apoyar estas nobles acciones. 🐾❤️

대통령실·총리·여당 2시 회동 예정 [이슈PLAY] / JTBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEeVGcEqOxU,6022,528212,150,"한덕수 국무총리가 4일 “이 시간 이후에도 내각은 소임을 다해 달라”며 “마지막 순간까지 국무위원들과 국민을 섬기겠다”고 밝혔습니다.

한 총리는 이날 오후 발표한 ‘국민께 드리는 말씀’에서 “국민 여러분의 불안이 크실 줄 안다. 내각을 통할하는 총리로서 작금의 상황에 이르게 된 모든 과정에 대해 책임을 통감하고 있다”고 했습니다.

한 총리는 그러면서 “이 시간 이후에도 내각은 국가의 안위와 국민의 일상이 한치 흔들림 없이 유지되도록 모든 부처와 공직자들과 함께 소임을 다해 달라”며 “마지막 순간까지 국무위원들과 중지(衆志)를 모아 국민을 섬기겠다”고 했습니다.

한 총리의 발표는 국무위원들의 사의를 일단 받아들이지 않고, 국정이 지속되도록 하겠다는 뜻을 밝힌 것으로 해석됩니다.

앞서 이날 오전 국무위원들은 한 총리와의 간담회에서 한 총리에게 사의를 표명한 것으로 알려졌습니다.

윤 대통령은 이날 오후 5시쯤 한덕수 국무총리와 한동훈 국민의힘 대표, 추경호 원내대표 등이 용산 대통령실에 방문해 회동한 자리에서 이같이 말한 것으로 알려졌습니다. 이 자리에는 박정하 당대표 비서실장과 주호영 의원, 나경원 의원, 김기현 의원 등도 참석한 것으로 전해졌습니다.

복수의 참석자들에 따르면 윤 대통령은 ""비상계엄 선포가 야당의 폭거로 어쩔 수 없이 일어났다""는 취지로 발언한 것으로 전해졌습니다. 윤 대통령은 비상계엄을 사전에 상의하지 않은 것에 대해선 보안 문제와 본인이 책임지기 위해서였다고 말한 것으로 알려졌습니다.

L112 ショッピングセンター,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKfkYHg1TZo,0,15,0,"本コースでは、あいさつや自己紹介のような定番フレーズのほかに、感情表現・家庭・友達作り・恋愛・スマホ・学校・ビジネス・旅行・現地生活など、幅広い場面に対応した2000の中国語会話フレーズと550の関連単語を、ビデオや音声を使って覚えることができます。

🟢 すべてのフレーズが10字以内、初心者にもおすすめ
すべてのフレーズが漢字10字以内で覚えやすく、かつネイティブが日常で使う実用的なものが中心です。また、日本人の目線から見て使ってみたくなるようなフレーズも豊富です。フレーズがシンプルなので、初心者の方でも気軽に取り組めます。

🟢 常用の中国語表現をたくさん用意
ある程度の学習経験のある方でも、「ガスが漏れています」や「これを電子レンジにかけて」のような一見簡単そうなフレーズが、とっさに口から出てこないことはよくあります。
本コースでは、文法や単語学習だけでは補いきれない、常用の中国語表現をたくさん用意しているので、マスターすれば「言いたいことがとっさに出てこない」という場面が少なくなることでしょう。

🟢 日本語→中国語の順に読み上げ
すべてのフレーズ・単語を、日本語→中国語の順に読み上げるので、テキスト無しでも学習することができます。

🟢 PDFテキストも用意
PDF形式のテキストでは、すべてのフレーズと注釈、関連単語を確認することができます。スマホやタブレットにいれておけば、見たいときにいつでも確認することができます。

🟢 このような方におすすめ
・少しでも中国語でコミュニケーションが取れるようになりたい方
・ネイティブ同士のシンプルな会話フレーズを覚えたい方
・旅行・短期出張に備えて、少し会話を覚えたい方
・駐在員・留学生など現地生活をこれから始める方
・『動画で身につく！中国語入門　発音＋文法』を学習中・学習予定の方

🟢 コースの内容
本教材は、5つのパートから構成されています。各パートでは、フレーズのほかに関連単語が紹介されています。

1. 基本のコミュニケーション編

あいさつ・質問・意志表示・感情表現など、場面を問わず使える基本的なコミュニケーションのフレーズをまとめています。初心者の方は、まずはここに出てくるフレーズを何度も練習してマスターしましょう。

2. 日常会話編

主に家庭内での会話や、友人・知人との会話を中心としたフレーズをまとめています。家庭内での会話は、どれもシンプルですが、学習経験者でも案外言えなかったりするものが多いので、そのまま暗記しておくことをおすすめします。

3. 学校・ビジネス編

学校生活や、社内・社外で使える簡単なビジネス会話フレーズをまとめています。ビジネス会話と聞くと難しくイメージしてしまうかもしれませんが、ここで出てくるフレーズは、業種を問わず使えるシンプルで覚えやすいものが中心です。

4. 旅行編

移動・宿泊・食事・買い物など、旅行に必要な定番のフレーズをまとめています。また、近年増加している中国からの観光客が、日本で買い物をするときに使うフレーズもまとめているので、必要な方は覚えておくと便利です。

5. 現地生活編

部屋探し・家のトラブル・電話の契約・銀行・オンラインショッピング・病院・散髪など、現地での生活に欠かせないフレーズをまとめています。留学生や駐在員などの方は、ここで紹介するフレーズを覚えておくと心強いでしょう。

(付録) 厳選フレーズ100

2000フレーズの中から厳選した、頻出の100フレーズを練習することができます。急な出張などで覚える時間がない方や、「とりあえず少しだけ話せるようになりたい」という方などにおすすめです。",2023-07-24T09:01:01Z,UCqYlZBjsGZFX3Ia0IyaT0cQ,カエルライフ - 中国語学習

Kalau nggak siap mikir, dan bera pendapat, jangan buka deh linknya

Karena kita bakal bahas:
1. Tentang kejadian dan kata-kata ""Goblok"" dan etikanya, adabnya
2. Tentang mental, kenapa kejadian itu bisa terjadi
3. Tentang efek dari kejadian itu, yang akhirnya agama yang disalahin, padahal orangnya yang nggak etis
4. Tentang bagaimana harusnya kita bersikap

"[이슈픽] 윤 대통령, &#39;왜 지금&#39; 비상계엄 선포했나 / YTN",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOJ4EfHQnYQ,399,108669,50,"윤석열 대통령은 국회의 계엄해제 요구가 뻔히 예상되는 상황에서도 전격적으로 비상계엄을 선포했습니다.

왜 그랬는지, 배경에 관심이 쏠리는데요,

야당의 감사원장 탄핵 등 전방위 공세에다 김 여사 특검법 재표결을 앞두고 여당 내 분열 조짐이 나타나자 무리수를 둔 게 아니냐는 관측이 나오고 있습니다.

===

1. 정치적 무리수 배경은?...""탄핵 공세·특검 이탈표 때문""(신윤정 기자 / 12.4 보도)
2. [뉴스UP] '비상계엄령' 선포 6시간 만에 종료...이후 파장은?(김광삼 변호사 출연  / 12.4 방송) 중 발췌
3. 용산, 계엄선포 4시간 전 경찰청장에 비상대기 지시(부장원 기자 / 12.4 보도)
4. 대법원장 ""국민 걱정 없도록 최선""...검찰 내부 반발도(김철희 기자 / 12.4 보도)
5. 여야, 긴급 의원총회...""대통령 탈당"" ""탄핵 추진""(김다연 기자 / 12.4 보도)
6. 전격적으로 이뤄진 계엄...여당 지도부도 몰랐다(김경수 기자 / 12.4 보도)
7. 대법원장 ""계엄, 어떤 절차 거쳤나 지켜봐야""...법원·검찰 구성원 비판도(김철희 기자 / 12.4 보도)
8. '비상계엄' 요건 충족했나...법조계 ""위헌성 다분""(김태원 기자 / 12.4 보도)

Shaolin Mantis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIwnh-3by7I,394,0,0,"Liu Chia-liang is arguably the best martial arts film director of traditional style kung-fu action and was a pioneer in focusing on authentic martial arts techniques and training procedures in his films.  This is the why stars in his movies looked more like kung-fu experts rather than actors simply going through the motions.  So although David Chiang had starred in over 40 films as a martial arts hero, in Shaolin Mantis, where he plays a man who learns martial arts from a praying mantis then seeks revenge for his wife's death, the movie contains some of Chiang's best fight scenes ever.  By casting his brothers Liu Chia-yung and Gordon Liu Chia-hui into the mix, Liu further ensures that the pugilistic mayhem will be even more outstanding.",2015-10-01T19:25:04Z,UCics_Nl02fb82U8dt0FdFlA,YouTube Movies

Instead, he'll just fix it himself.  Although Bug and Dog try to help, things spiral out of control, and soon Duck has broken a lamp, a lever and even Frog's log!  Duck learns that everyone makes mistakes and admitting them sooner rather than later can make a big difference. ""Catch that C!"" While Pig and Ant are making cookies, their bag of letter C's gets away from them, sending the WordFriends on a wild goose chase all over WordWorld to catch that C!  The bad news is that the letter C is in big demand that day.

UNKNOWN SISTERS OF MUKESH AMBANI!!! #mukeshambani #informative,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0U0DjA5bVw,47690,594263,105,"Mukesh Ambani has two sisters, but you might not know much about them.

One of his sisters manages her own business and is also a millionaire. Her name is Nina Kothari.

In 2003, she launched a coffee brand called Javagreen. However, she faced a tough time in 2015 when her husband, Bhadrashyam Kothari, passed away due to cancer.

Her husband was also a businessman and the owner of the HC Kothari Group. After his demise, Nina Kothari took over as the chairperson of the company. Under her leadership, the Kothari Group expanded significantly, and today, Nina Kothari's net worth is ₹52 crore.

The second sister is Dipti Salgaonkar, the youngest among the four siblings.

Dipti holds a law degree from Goa, and her husband, Dattaraj Salgaonkar, is the owner of the V.M. Salgaokar Group.

Both sisters regularly attend family functions but have kept themselves away from the limelight.",2024-12-03T17:26:29Z,UCHvKJ6u9t9weize9wSSwbBQ,Prabhjot Speaks

한밤중 국회 앞에 계엄군과 군용 차량까지...&quot;믿을 수가 없네요&quot; / YTN,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdgIVA36lXo,2788,324647,1462,"[앵커]
한국의 한밤중 계엄령 선포에 이어 몇 시간 뒤 국회의 해제 결의 소식을 외신들은 일제히 긴급뉴스로 전했습니다.

국회 앞에 등장한 계엄군과 군용차량 그리고 시위대의 모습들을 생생하게 전하며 한마디로 ""충격, 믿을 수 없다""고 보도했습니다.

박영진 기자가 보도합니다.

[기자]
한밤중 한국 대통령의 갑작스러운 계엄 선포는 우리 국민뿐 아니라 세계를 놀라게 했습니다.

외신들은 일제히 긴급뉴스로 전했습니다.

로이터통신은 이번 계엄선포가 ""1980년대 이후 민주적이라고 여겨온 한국에 큰 충격파를 던졌다""고 보도했습니다.

국회 상공엔 헬기가 뜨고, 국회 앞엔 군용차량이 등장해 시위대와 충돌하고, 계엄군은 유리창을 깨고 국회 안으로 진입하는

이 영화 같은 실제 상황을 전하는 CNN 기자는 ""믿을 수 없다""고 탄식합니다.

[마이크 발레리오 / CNN 기자 : 저는 지금 시위대 속에 있는데 군용 차량 두 대가 이곳을 빠져나가려고 하고 있습니다. 아, 여기 이걸 보세요. 믿을 수가 없네요.]

CNN은 ""한국의 정치가 오랫동안 분열됐고 당파적이었지만 민주주의 시대 그 어떤 지도자도 계엄령 선포까지 간 적은 없었다""면서 ""한국이 정치적 미지의 바다로 빠졌다""고 보도했습니다.

뉴욕타임스도 윤 대통령의 계엄선포는 ""정치적 교착 상태에 대한 이례적인 대응""이라고 평가하면서, 국회의 계엄 해제 의결에 대해 ""한국 의원들이 계엄령 종료를 요구하면서 대통령에 도전하는 투표를 했다""고 보도했습니다.

일본 언론과 중국 관영 매체들도 관련 소식을 발 빠르게 보도했습니다.

특히 중국 최대 검색 포털 바이두에서는 한국의 비상계엄 선포 소식이 검색어 1위에 오르기도 했습니다.

TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Presiden Prabowo Subianto gerak cepat mengirim bantuan ke Sunhaji, penjual es teh yang dihina Gus Miftah. 

Adapun bantuan berupa modal usaha itu diberikan langsung ke Sunhaji. 

Momen pemberian bantuan modal usaha itu diungah di Instagram story Gerindra pada Rabu (4/12). 

Dinarasikan, Prabowo mengirim utusan yakni admin Partai Gerindra untuk memberikan bantuan tersebut. 

Lantas, admin Partai Gerindra menelepon utusannya untuk datang ke rumah Sunhaji.

Dalam video itu terlihat pria berkemeja putih memberikan segepok uang tunai yang tak diketahui jumlahnya. 

Ia menegaskan Presiden Prabowo tidak sepakat dengan kata-kata yang dilontarkan Gus Miftah. 

Dengan mata berkaca-kaca, Sunhaji mengucapkan terima kasi kepada Prabowo yang telah memberikan bantuan kepadanya. 

Sunhaji pun mendoakan agar Prabowo diberi keberkahan.

"한동훈 대표 등 당 지도부, 윤 대통령과 회동...한동훈 &quot;윤 대통령 탈당 요구, 한총리·비서실장에 전달했다” [이슈PLAY] / JTBC News",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHB3yvRdrGk,1989,256659,77,"윤석열 대통령과 김용현 국방장관에 대한 야당의 탄핵소추안 국회 본회의 보고 전 열린 국민의힘 의원총회에 앞서, 한동훈 대표가 ""계엄은 경고성일 수 없다""고 밝혔습니다.

한동훈 국민의힘 대표는 오늘 밤 10시쯤 국회 본관에서 기자들과 만나, '대통령이 비상계엄을 선포한 게 경고성일 뿐이라고 말했다는 데 대해 어떻게 생각하느냐'는 질문에 ""계엄이 그렇게 경고성일 수는 없다, 계엄을 그렇게 쓸 수 있겠느냐""고 답했습니다.

윤 대통령에게 탈당 요구를 했느냐는 질문에는 ""탈당 요구를 해야 된다는 건 최고위에서 저희가 결정했던 것이고, 총리실에서 회의할 때 총리님과 비서실장께 제가 전달했다""고 설명했습니다.

윤석열 대통령 탄핵에 찬성하는지 묻는 질문엔 ""그런 질문을 하나하나 답하진 않겠다""며 말을 아꼈고, 김용현 국방장관 탄핵안에 대해선 ""의원총회에서 잘 결정할 것이라고 생각한다""고 밝혔습니다.

윤석열 대통령과 여당 지도부의 만남 이후 '어떤 경우에라도 대통령의 임기 중단이 있어선 안 된다는 뜻이 모아졌다'는 보도에 대해서는 ""보도가 수정됐다""며 일축했습니다.

REDEVIDA AO VIVO - 24 HORAS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XraXo1cd0TM,19292,2673851,0,"REDEVIDA O Canal da Família | Ao Vivo 24 Horas

A REDEVIDA é o canal da família por sua inspiração cristã, por seus compromissos morais e éticos, por sua vocação para o serviço, a valorização humana e social. Consagrada à Nossa Senhora em Fátima e confirmada a dedicação no Santuário Nacional de Aparecida, a REDEVIDA nasceu em 20 de junho de 1995. O projeto foi iniciativa de um leigo católico, o Jornalista João Monteiro de Barros Filho. A ideia recebeu adesão do então arcebispo de Botucatu, Dom Antônio Maria Mucciolo e de Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida, então arcebispo de Mariana.
Com o apoio de dioceses, paróquias, congregações e com o auxilio de leigos engajados surgiu o INBRAC, Instituto Brasileiro de Comunicação Cristã, o órgão sem finalidades lucrativas que operacionalizou a implantação da REDEVIDA. A estrela da REDEVIDA brilha em todo o Brasil, de norte a sul! Com cobertura em canal aberto VHF e UHF, a REDEVIDA está presente em todas as capitais brasileiras e as 500 maiores cidades do Brasil, alcançando mais de 1.500 municípios.

A REDEVIDA já está presente em mais de 300 destas localidades com canal digital.
Possui a maior distribuição de TV por assinatura do país e está disponível também através das antenas parabólicas, em sinal digital e analógico.
São 24 horas diárias de programação produzida em HD, tanto na sede e geradora em São José do Rio Preto no interior de São Paulo, como nos estúdios auxiliares na capital de São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre e Brasília, além de produções independentes e matérias jornalísticas enviadas de diversas outras localidades do país e do mundo.

Habilidad frente a tamaño #shorts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jV18Ne2MLI,134755,2391792,297,"Este chico pesa 50 kg y está a punto de enfrentarse a alguien que pesa el doble que él. Su oponente recurre a la técnica más odiada en el Jiu-Jitsu: ¡simplemente sentarse! Pero este chico responde con un contraataque perfecto. Aunque lo revierten, gracias a su increíble flexibilidad, atrapa la pierna de su oponente y asegura un gancho de talón, obligándolo a rendirse y ganando la pelea contra un oponente mucho más grande. #deportes #talento #jiujitsu #TécnicaSobreFuerza #HabilidadVsTamaño",2024-12-02T00:30:07Z,UC6KqYa6wbZho4l81DaLYJ4A,Andrés Andel
