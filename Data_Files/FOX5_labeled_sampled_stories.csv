judicial vacancies in dc courts result in delays and increased workloads,"d.c. courts are currently facing significant vacancies, leading to serious consequences such as higher caseloads for judges and delayed trials.",,"washington-d.c. courts are currently facing significant vacancies, leading to serious consequences such as higher caseloads for judges and delayed trials. the issue is also causing the public to wait longer for justice. the d.c. judicial system hasn't had a full bench in 11 years, resulting in the remaining judges struggling to keep up with the workload. in an urgent cry for help, dc courts sent a letter to lawmakers. ""we need to kick and scream in an effort to get the senate to start paying attention to the true judicial vacancy crisis the dc courts are facing,"" said spokesperson doug buchanan to fox 5. d.c. council chairman phil mendelson is actively addressing the ongoing problem. ""well, this is a dirty little secret, members of congress say ‘oh the district doesn’t need its own representatives in the senate and house because we represent everybody,’ well they don’t,"" mendelson said. ""i’ve been trying to get a meeting with senators for months."" currently, the court of appeals is down two judges, equating to a 22 percent deficit, while the superior court is short by ten judges, equating to a 16 percent deficit. u.s. attorney matthew graves highlighted the impact, stating, ""fewer judges mean fewer courtrooms where we can try cases."" this shortage is delaying justice for victims and preventing others from resolving crucial issues. ""i think it’s unfortunate that they are affected, adversely affected by this,"" said mendelson. the judicial backlog is evident with a 200-day delay in criminal cases compared to 2019, and only half the number of criminal cases being closed compared to that year. trial dates are now being pushed back to late 2025 and 2026, raising concerns about suspects having the opportunity to commit more crimes. ""well, it’s a concern whether or not the suspect or defendant is released on his own recognizance or is being held either way,"" mendelson stated. ""the research is very clear – swift and certain justice has its deterrent effect on crime. if someone commits a crime and doesn’t go to trial for a year or two, you lose the deterrent effect."" chairman mendelson hopes the senate will stop playing politics and quickly confirm judges. ""for mystery reasons, senators have the slows with this,"" he said. ""it confuses me why there would be partisan issues over d.c. trial court judges. these are not judges who are considering federal issues, they’re not considering issues that are important politically."" despite the recent swearing-in of two associate judges, d.c. leaders say it’s still not enough to deal with the backlog of cases.",Not relevant,Not relevant,Not relevant

""we’re supposed to be pivoting into celebrating the holiday season, but citizens continue to be afraid,"" henderson told fox 5 the night before. earlier this week, mayor bowser was asked about everything being done to address d.c. violence not seeming to work. her response had to do with containing to push until the ""ecosystem corrects itself."" when fox 5 asked how long it would take, bowser said, ""we’re working on it every single day."" in response to a question about whether something drastic needs to be done to address the level of gun violence, she replied: ""i talk about what we’re doing every single day."" damon donelson —  who told fox 5 he was born and raised in d.c. and is now a georgetown pivot program fellow — believes there is important work being done on the ground to address the violence that’s not always seen. he also says more needs to be done to hear from the youth and families in different communities experiencing different issues in their various neighborhoods. he does not see police arresting their way out of this violence as a full solution. donelson was out celebrating theopening of the holiday marketon friday. ""regardless of what’s going on, even in the face of disaster, washingtonians are always eager to get into the holiday mood because average life is so dreary throughout the course of the year that, we look for something to celebrate,"" he said.

hunter biden's law license suspended in dc following historic guilty verdict,hunter biden's license to practice law in the district of columbia was suspended following a jury finding him guilty in his criminal gun trial earlier this month.,,"washington-hunter biden's license to practice law in the district of columbia was suspended following a jury finding him guilty in his criminal gun trial earlier this month. as of tuesday morning, biden is ""suspended immediately from the practice of law"" inwashington, d.c., pending a formal proceeding that will determine whether to uphold the suspension. the district of columbia court of appeals e-filing system shows the order was filed on tuesday. the office of the disciplinary counsel in washington, d.c., sent a letter to the d.c. court of appeals last week seeking to suspend biden's license after his guilty verdict on june 11. the suspension only affects his ability to practice law in washington, d.c. the d.c. bar's website still lists robert hunter biden as being in ""good standing"" and ""active"" as of tuesday morning, fox news digital found. the page shows he has been licensed to practice law in washington, d.c., since 2007. biden earned a juris doctor degree from yale university in 1996 and previously worked for law firm boies schiller flexner. fox news digital reached out to biden's defense attorney abbe lowell's office for comment but did not immediately receive a reply. biden was found guilty on june 11 of lying about his drug use when purchasing a firearm in 2018. he was found guilty on three charges: making a false statement in the purchase of a gun, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed gun dealer, and possession of a gun by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance. biden had pleaded not guilty in the case. prosecutors worked to prove that biden lied on a federal firearm form, known as atf form 4473, in october 2018, when he ticked the ""no"" box when asked if he is an unlawful user of substances or addicted to controlled substances. biden has a long history of drug abuse, which was underscored in his 2021 memoir ""beautiful things."" the book was repeatedly referenced by both prosecutors and biden's defense team amid the nearly seven-day trial. the memoir walks readers through biden's highs and lows with addiction to crack cocaine and attempts to get sober. lowell did not deny biden's long history with substance abuse amid the trial, instead arguing that on the day biden bought the cobra colt .38, he did not consider himself an active drug addict. lowell cited the first son's stint in rehab ahead of the october 2018 purchase. prosecutors, however, argued biden was addicted to crack cocaine before, during and after he bought the handgun. in addition to citing biden's memoir, the prosecution team also presented the jury with text messages biden shared with family and apparent drug dealers to prove his addiction around the time period he purchased the firearm. just one day after the gun purchase, prosecutors showed the court that biden texted hallie biden, his sister-in-law turned girlfriend, to say he was ""waiting for a dealer named mookie."" a day after that text, he texted that he was ""sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th street and rodney"" in wilmington. three of biden’s exes took the stand and testified during the trial, making court proceedings emotional at times. biden's ex-wife, kathleen buhle, who was married to biden for more than 20 years and with whom she shares three adult daughters, was among those who took the stand and told the jury about her experiences with biden when he was using drugs. ""i was definitely worried, scared,"" she said, describing how she would scour his car for drugs and drug paraphernalia to ensure their daughters would not drive the vehicle around with the substances. biden's ex-girlfriend, zoe kestan, also took the stand, walking the jury through biden’s rampant drug abuse throughout their relationship, including him smoking crack in hotel rooms, stealing away to public bathrooms to smoke crack and how she helped pick up drugs for him. she said the crack cocaine he purchased often was the size of a ""ping pong ball,"" which he broke into pieces and lit up in glass pipes. kestan testified under immunity. the jury took roughly three hours across two days to reach the guilty verdict. biden will be sentenced later this year, though no date has yet been issued. the law license suspension in washington, d.c., comes after biden's defense team re-submitted a motion requesting a new criminal trial, arguing the federal court in delaware lacked jurisdiction to go to trial earlier this month. the motion comes one week after lowell filed a similar motion but quickly withdrew it without explanation. read the full dc court of appeals order below:",Other ,,

""emerging from the warmest january on record, this has been a particularly puzzling year to read the trees and established date for peak bloom,"" said jeff reinbold, the superintendent of the national mall and memorial parks for the national park service, back in february. steadily rising global temperatures and the fact that the cherry trees never reached dormancy over the winter months have resulted in peak bloom creeping a little earlier. read more:cherry blossoms reach peak bloom after warm weekend warm weekend temperatures sped up the arrival of peak bloom. so, will cooler temperatures cause them to disappear sooner? not at all, said national park service spokesman mike litterst. ""concern should be the last thing on anybody’s mind,"" litterst said. ""the cool weather is actually going to keep the blossoms on the trees a little bit longer than they might normally."" litterst said the next phase after peak bloom is when we go from blossoms to leaves. warm temperatures tend to speed up that process. ""so, the cooler the temperatures, the longer the blossoms will stay before they become leaves,"" he said. litterst said temperatures of 27 degrees or below could do damage to the cherry blossom petals. but temperatures that low are not in the forecast. fox 5’s tucker barnes said winds shouldn’t be an issue either.  ""i don't think the winds will be so strong that we're worried about cherry blossoms flying. but they will occasionally gust from 20-25 mph."" typically, there is a big rush before the sun comes up, especially with photographers who are looking for the perfect sunrise shot. from, mid to late morning, there is usually a lull around the tidal basin. the foot traffic starts to pick up after school and work and gets heavier and heavier until sunset.

let's take a look back at the largest blizzards our area has ever seen... the most recent major blizzard to hit our region occurred 8 years ago in the middle of what was actually one of the warmest winters in dmv history. the powerful blizzard buried suburbs like north potomac, md in nearly 40"" of snow. over 100,000 people lost power as winds gusted over 50 mph. nationally, the storm caused ½ a billion dollars in damages and caused the deaths of 55 people. it was a category 5 blizzard on theregional snowfall index scale (rsi), the most extreme category. the storm that would go down in the history books as ""snowmageddon."" it was the most impactful blizzard of the snowiest winter in dmv history. the storm struck on a friday with heavy snow falling well into the morning hours of saturday. elkridge, md saw the highest snowfall totals with just over 38"" of snow, while dulles airport picked up just about 33"". a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, its impact was exacerbated a second blizzard on february 9-10 that added an additional foot of snow in many locations. this was the first storm of the monster 2009-2010 winter that would bring nearly 60"" of snow in total to the area. this blizzard remains the most intense to ever hit our area in the month of december. a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, this storm brought olney, md nearly two feet of snowfall in the days before christmas. enough snow fell that d.c. was still reporting over half a foot on the ground during christmas day. known to many as the presidents' day storm of 2003, this storm could have been significantly worse for the district had sleet not mixed in with the snow during the latter half of the storm. this rsi category 4 blizzard remains the snowiest on record for baltimore, where over 28"" of snow was measured officially. dc, boston, new york and places in-between picked up over a foot of snow, crippling the i-95 corridor. one of only three blizzards to ever receive a category 5 ranking on the rsi scale, this powerful storm dropped over two feet of snow at dulles airport, while parts of the west virginia mountains received four feet of snow. much of the i-81 corridor received over 30"" of snow. the storm is believed to have been a factor in a deadly metro crash at shady grove station. you can also view this look back on youtube. this blizzard, known as the ""megalopolitan blizzard of 1983,"" is remembered widely for its intense episodes of ""thundersnow,"" mostly across maryland during the height of the storm. germantown and frederick, md each received over 30"" of snow, while western loudoun county received as much as 3 feet. a category 4 blizzard on the rsi scale, the storm is also known for sinking a bulk carrier, the ss marine electric, off the virginia coastline, killing 31 crew. the original president's day blizzard, this storm was known for catching our region completely off guard. weather forecasting has come a long way since the 1970s, but back then the guidance available to weather forecasters did not show a major storm until about 24 hours prior to the first snow falling. after an initial snow of about 4,"" a rapidly intensifying nor’easter brought snowfall rates exceeding 5"" per hour to some locations, and areas within the beltway picked up nearly 2 feet of snow. another winter that featured two blizzards, though the second one in march 1958 mostly impacted areas farther northwest of the d.c. metro area, this blizzard was part of a powerful coastal nor’easter remembered as being one of the worst for portions of the interior northeast. the blizzard buried the dc-baltimore corridor in a widespread 1-2 feet of snow. coming in the midst of what remains the coldest february for the contiguous united states, the storm is remembered for it’s widespread heavy snows across the entirety of the mid-atlantic. even the lower eastern shore, which typically sees warm air aloft keep snowfall rates down due to ocean interference, picked up widespread 12-18"" of snowfall. extreme snow in the mountains followed by continued cold temperatures and a lack of melting were the precursors to the great spring flood of march 1936, which was one of the worst recorded flooding events for our region. what still stands as the snowiest single storm in dc area history happened over a century ago.now infamously known as the ""knickerbocker blizzard"" after the heavy snows caused the collapse of the roof of the knickerbocker theater, killing nearly 100 people who were attending a showing ofget-rich-quick wallingfordduring the height of the storm. it was an extremely rare case of a cutoff-low nor’easter, which caused the storm to move at nearly half the forward speed of a typical blizzard up the east coast. richmond (19""), washington, d.c.
